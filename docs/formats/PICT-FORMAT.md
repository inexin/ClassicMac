# The QuickDraw PICT format — an implementer's specification

This document describes the Macintosh QuickDraw picture format (PICT) completely enough to write a decoder that
renders pictures pixel for pixel as a Macintosh does, and an encoder whose output a Macintosh reads. It is the
behaviour implemented by ClassicMac.Graphics and ClassicMac.ImageSharp, written so that the code never has to be read.

There are two reference implementations, and they differ in details:

- **Mac OS 9** replaced most of QuickDraw (DrawPicture, CopyBits, the shape procedures, text and the Font Manager)
  with a native PowerPC rewrite. This is what current Macs-in-emulation (SheepShaver, and anything running Mac OS 9)
  show, and it is the **default** of ClassicMac.Graphics.
- **The Macintosh ROM** (Mac OS ROM 1.6, `$077D`) holds the last Apple revision of the classic 68k QuickDraw, which
  every Mac before Mac OS 9 used.

Sections 2–16 describe the ROM behaviour, marked **ROM** where it is surprising. Section 17 lists every point where
Mac OS 9 differs.

## 1. Conventions

- All multi-byte values are **big-endian**.
- `u8/u16/u32` are unsigned, `i8/i16/i32` signed.
- `Rect` is four `i16`: **top, left, bottom, right**. Right and bottom are exclusive, so a rect covers
  `right − left` × `bottom − top` pixels. A rect is empty when `bottom ≤ top` or `right ≤ left`.
- `Point` is two `i16`: **v, h** (vertical first).
- `Fixed` is a signed 16.16 fixed-point `i32`.
- `RGBColor` is three `u16`: red, green, blue. An 8-bit component is the high byte.
- Coordinates are QuickDraw's: the grid lines lie between pixels. Pixel (h, v) is the one below and to the right of
  grid point (h, v).
- **16-bit arithmetic.** QuickDraw computes coordinates in 16-bit words, and several results below depend on that
  wrap-around. "(short)" means: truncate to 16 bits and sign-extend.
- Mode, opcode and constant values are given in hex (`$xx` or `0xXX`) or decimal as noted.

---

## 2. Container

### 2.1 Files and resources

A picture is stored either as:

- the data of a `PICT` resource: the picture itself; or
- a `.pict` file: **512 bytes of application header**, then the picture.

The file header is normally all zeros, but some creators fill it (MacDraw writes `DRWG…`, MacDraft `pictDF…`). Do
not require zeros. Instead, look for the version opcode (§2.3) at offset 10: if it is not there but is at offset
512 + 10, skip the 512 bytes.

Detection without a file extension:

- **Bare picture:** the picFrame (bytes 2–9) is non-empty, and either
  - the bytes at offset 10 are `11 01` (version 1), or
  - the bytes at offset 10 are `00 11 02 FF 0C 00` (version 2 with its header opcode).
- **`.pict` file:** the same test at offset 512. For version 1, also require an all-zero header, because two bytes
  are a weak signature.

### 2.2 Picture header

| Offset | Type | Field |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | u16 | `picSize`: the low 16 bits of the picture size. Unreliable for version 2; ignore it. |
| 2 | Rect | `picFrame`: the picture's bounding box at 72 dpi. |
| 10 | … | the version opcode |

### 2.3 Version

- **Version 1:** the byte opcode `$11` followed by the byte `$01` (the word `0x1101`). All following opcodes are
  **one byte**, and there is no alignment.
- **Version 2:** the word opcode `0x0011` followed by the word `0x02FF`. All following opcodes are **two bytes**,
  and each opcode starts at an **even offset** from the start of the picture. Skip a pad byte after odd-length
  operands. The `$FF` of `0x02FF` is a filler, which the alignment rule absorbs.

A version-2 picture normally continues with the **header opcode `0x0C00`** and 24 bytes of data:

| Offset | Type | Extended version 2 (version field −2) | Version 2 (version field −1) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | i16 | version = −2 | version = −1 |
| 2 | u16 | reserved | reserved |
| 4 | Fixed | hRes (dpi) | bounding box left (Fixed) |
| 8 | Fixed | vRes (dpi) | bounding box top… (Fixed) |
| 12 | Rect | `srcRect`: the optimal source rect, in hRes/vRes units | …right, bottom (Fixed) |
| 20 | u32 | reserved | reserved |

- If the word after `0x0011 0x02FF` is not `0x0C00` (or fewer than 26 bytes remain), there is no header. That word
  is the first drawing opcode.
- Only version −2 changes anything: its opcodes draw in the coordinate space of `srcRect` (if non-empty), at
  `hRes × vRes`. Version −1 draws in `picFrame` at 72 dpi.
- The mid-stream opcode `0x0011` may switch versions: the next byte gives the new version (1 = byte opcodes,
  2 = word opcodes).

### 2.4 The drawing space and the canvas

- **fromRect**: the rect the picture's coordinates are expressed in. This is `srcRect` for an extended version-2
  picture (when non-empty), else `picFrame`.
- **toRect**: the rect the picture is drawn into. A decoder chooses it:
  - **Native resolution:** a canvas the size of fromRect, with toRect = (0, 0, height, width). Pixels map 1:1 and
    nothing is scaled.
  - **72 dpi:** a canvas the size of `picFrame`. When the sizes differ, every coordinate is scaled (§6), exactly as
    `DrawPicture` scales into a destination rect of another size.

The canvas starts transparent (§8.1).

---

## 3. The opcode stream

Opcodes are read in a loop until `0x00FF` (OpEndPic) or the end of the data. In version 1, an opcode is one byte and
its value is the same number (`$FF` ends it).

### 3.1 Operand sizes

Every opcode's length is fixed by the table below, so unknown opcodes can be skipped. The ROM's own skip rules for
reserved ranges are given, and they differ from Inside Macintosh in places (marked **ROM**).

Notes:

- **Bit 3 of the bitmap opcodes is ignored (ROM).** `0x90`/`0x91` are read exactly like `0x98`/`0x99`: the pixel
  data is PackBits whenever rowBytes ≥ 8 (§5). `0x92`/`0x93` are DirectBits.
- **Version-2 drawing opcodes in version-1 pictures** use the same numbers as bytes (`$30` frameRect, and so on).
  PnLocHFrac, ChExtra, LineJustify, glyphState and anything above `$FF` do not occur in version 1.
- **Text in DHText/DVText:** dh and dv are unsigned bytes, so text only moves right and down.

### 3.2 Opcodes that are read but draw nothing

- 0x0017–0x0019, every reserved opcode, and ShortComment/LongComment are consumed and otherwise ignored.
- The only exception is comment 224, which carries the ICC profile (§14).

---

## 4. Operand structures

### 4.1 Region

| Type | Field |
|---|---|
| u16 | `rgnSize`: bytes including this word and the bbox. Mask off bit 15. |
| Rect | `rgnBBox` |
| i16[] | `(rgnSize − 10) / 2` words of scan data (a pad byte follows if rgnSize is odd) |

- A region of size 10 (no scan data) is its bounding rectangle.
- Otherwise the scan data is a list of rows, then a final `0x7FFF`. Each row is:
  - `y`;
  - then x values, in increasing order;
  - then `0x7FFF`.
- The x values are **inversion points**. At each (x, y), the inside/outside state of every pixel at or right of x
  and at or below y is flipped.
- Equivalently, a pixel is inside when the count of inversion points (x′, y′) with x′ ≤ x and y′ ≤ y is odd. XOR
  the x lists of successive rows to get each row's set of span boundaries.

To write a region, emit only the points where a band's spans change against the band above it: the symmetric
difference of the two span-boundary sets.

### 4.2 Polygon

| Type | Field |
|---|---|
| u16 | `polySize` in bytes, including this word |
| Rect | bounding box |
| Point[] | `(polySize − 10) / 4` points |

Skip any leftover bytes of polySize. A polygon with an **empty bounding box** draws nothing.

### 4.3 Pattern (1-bit)

- 8 bytes, one per row, with the most significant bit leftmost.
- A 1 bit draws the foreground colour and a 0 bit the background colour (§10).
- The pattern tiles the plane from the **drawing origin** (§6.4).

### 4.4 PixPat (BkPixPat / PnPixPat / FillPixPat)

| Type | Field |
|---|---|
| u16 | `patType` |
| 8 bytes | a 1-bit pattern (the fallback for 1-bit ports) |
| … | if `patType == 2` (dither pattern): an **RGBColor** (6 bytes; some readers wrongly skip 5) |
| … | otherwise: a PixMap **without baseAddr** (rowBytes, bounds, the PixMap fields of §4.5), a ColorTable, then its pixel data (§5) |

- A type-2 pattern draws as that solid colour.
- A type-1 pattern tiles its pixel map. Pixel (x, y) of the pattern is `((x + patAlign.h) mod w, y mod h)`. **ROM:**
  only the horizontal origin shift applies to pixel patterns (see §6.4).

### 4.5 BitMap, PixMap and bitmap opcode operands

**Bitmap opcodes 0x90, 0x91, 0x98, 0x99:**

| Type | Field |
|---|---|
| u16 | `rowBytes`: bit 15 set → a PixMap follows; the low 14 bits are the row length |
| Rect | `bounds` |
| — | if PixMap: the PixMap fields below, then a ColorTable |
| Rect | srcRect |
| Rect | dstRect |
| u16 | transfer mode |
| Region | mask region (0x91, 0x99 only) |
| — | pixel data (§5) |

A plain BitMap (bit 15 clear) is 1 bit per pixel with the palette {0: white, 1: black}.

**Direct opcodes 0x9A, 0x9B (and 0x92, 0x93):** `u32 baseAddr` (always `0x000000FF`; ignore it), then the same
layout as above with a PixMap and **no ColorTable**.

**PixMap fields** (after rowBytes and bounds):

| Type | Field |
|---|---|
| u16 | pmVersion |
| u16 | `packType` |
| u32 | packSize |
| Fixed | hRes |
| Fixed | vRes |
| u16 | `pixelType`: 0 = indexed, 16 = direct (RGBDirect) |
| u16 | `pixelSize`: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 or 32 (anything else is not a QuickDraw depth) |
| u16 | `cmpCount`: 1 indexed, 3 RGB, 4 with alpha |
| u16 | cmpSize |
| u32 | planeBytes |
| u32 | pmTable |
| u32 | pmReserved |

**In-memory layout** (after unpacking):

- Rows of `rowBytes` bytes.
- Indexed pixels are packed most significant first.
- 16-bit pixels are big-endian `xRRRRRGGGGGBBBBB`. Expand a 5-bit component to 8 bits as `(c << 3) | (c >> 2)`.
- 32-bit pixels are four bytes: **alpha/pad, R, G, B**.

### 4.6 ColorTable

| Type | Field |
|---|---|
| u32 | ctSeed |
| u16 | ctFlags: bit 15 set → a device table |
| u16 | ctSize: entry count − 1 |
| entries | u16 value, u16 r, u16 g, u16 b |

- In a device table each entry is the pixel value of its **position**. Otherwise each entry's `value` field is its
  pixel value.
- Pixel values the table does not list are black.

### 4.7 Classic colour constants (FgColor / BkColor)

| Constant | Colour | RGB (16-bit) |
|---|---|---|
| 30 | whiteColor | FFFF FFFF FFFF |
| 33 | blackColor | 0000 0000 0000 |
| 69 | yellowColor | FC00 F37D 052F |
| 137 | magentaColor | F2D7 0856 84EC |
| 205 | redColor | DD6B 08C2 06A2 |
| 273 | cyanColor | 0241 AB54 EAFF |
| 341 | greenColor | 0000 8000 11B0 |
| 409 | blueColor | 0000 0000 D400 |

Any other value gives black as a foreground colour and white as a background colour. On a colour port, ForeColor and
BackColor set these RGB colours from the QDColors table (`clut` 127 in the ROM).

---

## 5. Pixel data

### 5.1 PackBits

A packed scan line is:

- a **byte count** (a u8, or a **u16 when rowBytes > 250**);
- then that many bytes of runs, each starting with a flag byte `n` (i8):
  - `n ≥ 0`: copy the next `n + 1` units;
  - `n < 0` and `n ≠ −128`: repeat the next unit `1 − n` times;
  - `n = −128`: no-op.

A unit is a byte, except for **word packing** (packType 3), where it is two bytes. Stop at the row length; ignore
extra bytes inside the counted block.

### 5.2 Which rows are packed (ROM)

The ROM's rules are simpler and stranger than Inside Macintosh's. Apply them in this order:

1. **rowBytes < 8:** the rows are stored unpacked (`rowBytes × height` bytes), whatever the opcode or packType.
2. **Direct PixMap** (`pixelType == 16`), dispatched on **packType only**. pixelSize is never checked, so a 16-bit
   map with packType 0, 2 or 4 is decoded as nonsense exactly as on a Macintosh.
   - packType **1**: unpacked.
   - packType **0 or 2**: `(rowBytes / 4) × height × 3` bytes with no row counts: R, G, B per pixel, stored as
     0RGB.
   - packType **3**: PackBits over 16-bit words, per row.
   - packType **4**: per row, one PackBits line holding `planes = clamp(cmpCount, 1, 4)` component planes, each
     `rowBytes / 4` bytes. The planes are written to pixel bytes `4 − planes … 3`, so with 3 planes alpha stays 0
     and the planes are R, G, B; with 4 they are A, R, G, B.
   - packType **≥ 5**: each row's packed bytes are read and discarded, and the pixels stay zero.
3. **Everything else** (1-bit BitMaps and indexed PixMaps, whatever the packType and whichever bitmap opcode): one
   PackBits line per row. **packType is ignored** for indexed data, even packType 1.

### 5.3 Alpha

In a 32-bit map with cmpCount 4, the first byte of each pixel is alpha. QuickDraw ignores alpha when drawing. A
decoder may keep it for srcCopy transfers (§11.6).

---

## 6. Play state and coordinate mapping

### 6.1 Initial state

`DrawPicture` starts with:

- **Pen:** location (0, 0), size 1×1, mode patCopy.
- **Patterns:** pen and fill black, background white.
- **Colours:** foreground black, background white, OpColor black. Highlight colour is the system default: `$9999/$CCCC/$CCCC`
  in the ROM, lavender `$CCCC/$CCCC/$FFFF` on Mac OS 9 (Appearance default). DefHilite restores it. A decoder should
  let the caller choose it.
- **Text:** font 0, face 0, mode srcOr, size 0, space extra 0, character extra 0, pen fraction ½ (`$8000`).
- **Text ratio:** numer = toRect size, denom = fromRect size (§12.7).
- **Clip:** none.
- **Pattern origin:** (0, 0).
- **No font-name mappings.**

### 6.2 MapPt, MapRect, ScaleSize (ROM)

Every point is mapped from fromRect to toRect, per axis. For a coordinate `c` on an axis where fromRect spans
`[fromLo, fromHi)` and toRect `[toLo, toHi)`:

```
fromSize = (short)(fromHi - fromLo);  toSize = (short)(toHi - toLo)
d = (short)(c - fromLo)
if fromSize != toSize:
    negative = d < 0;  if negative: d = (short)-d
    p = (u16)d * (u16)toSize + ((u16)fromSize >> 1)        // unsigned 32-bit
    q = p / (u16)fromSize
    d = q > 0xFFFF ? (short)p : (short)q                     // an overflowing divide leaves the product
    if negative: d = (short)-d
result = (short)(d + toLo)
```

- The rounding is **half up on the magnitude**, so negative offsets round symmetrically with positive ones.
- MapRect maps top-left and bottom-right as points.
- **Pen and oval sizes (ScaleSize):**
  - if the sizes are equal, the value is unchanged;
  - a size ≤ 0 becomes 0;
  - otherwise the result is `((u16)size × (u16)toSize + fromSize/2) / fromSize`, and at least 1.

### 6.3 MapRgn and MapPoly

- **Regions:** map every inversion point with MapPt, then rebuild the region from the mapped points. If the sizes
  are equal, just offset it.
- **ROM:** the wide-open region, a rectangle of (−32767, −32767, 32767, 32767) with no scan data, is **not mapped**.
- **Polygons:** map every vertex.

### 6.4 Origin

The Origin opcode's operands are `dh` then `dv` (two `i16`, horizontal first: not a Point), as Mac OS 9.0's
DrawPicture reads them. It adds dh to fromRect's left and right and dv to its top and bottom, cumulatively
(each Origin adds to the previous shift until the next DrawPicture). All later coordinates therefore land dh, dv further
up and left. It also:

- adds (dh, dv) to the **pattern alignment** (patAlign);
- re-maps the current clip (kept in picture coordinates).

### 6.5 Clip

- The clip region is stored in picture coordinates and mapped (§6.3) whenever it or fromRect changes.
- Every drawing operation is limited to the mapped clip and the canvas.

### 6.6 MapFixPt (text positions only, ROM)

Version-2 text positions are mapped with fixed-point precision. For each axis, on a Fixed coordinate `c`:

```
fromSize = (fromHi << 16) - (fromLo << 16)     // 32-bit
toSize   = (toHi << 16) - (toLo << 16)
d = c - (fromLo << 16)
if fromSize != toSize: d = (int)((long)d * toSize / fromSize)   // signed 64/32 divide, truncating toward zero
result = d + (toLo << 16)
```

---

## 7. Fixed-point arithmetic

These must be exact: they decide pixel positions.

- **FixMul(a, b):**
  - If b = 1.0 return a; if a = 1.0 return b.
  - Otherwise take `p = (long)a × b`.
  - If p ≥ 2⁴⁷ or p < −2⁴⁷, saturate to `0x7FFFFFFF` or `0x80000000` by the operands' signs.
  - Otherwise `r = p >> 16` (floor). Add 1 when bit 15 of p is set and either r ≥ 0 or the low 15 bits are
    non-zero. This rounds half away from zero.
- **FixRatio(n, d)** (i16 operands):
  - If d = 0: `0x7FFFFFFF`, or `0x80000001` when n < 0.
  - If n = d: `0x10000`.
  - If n = −32768 and d = −1: `0x80000000`.
  - Otherwise `(n << 16) / d`, truncated toward zero.
- **FixRound(x):**
  - If x ≥ `0x7FFF8000`, return 32767.
  - Otherwise `(x + (x ≥ 0 ? 0x8000 : 0x7FFF)) >> 16` as an i16. This rounds halves away from zero.
- **SlopeFromAngle(a):**
  - Reduce a (i16) modulo 180 into [0, 180).
  - Return `-Tangent[a]` for a ≤ 90, else `Tangent[180 − a]`.
  - `Tangent[k]` is QuickDraw's table of tan(k°) as Fixed, **not** exactly rounded tangents. Use exactly these 91
    values:

```

## 8. The rendering model

### 8.1 Canvas

- The canvas is 32-bit RGBA and starts **fully transparent**.
- For every transfer mode, a transparent pixel reads as **white**, because the port behind the picture is white.
- Every pixel a drawing operation writes becomes opaque, except that bitmaps may carry alpha (§11.6).
- Pixels a picture never writes stay transparent, so callers can composite the result.

The ROM draws into a 32-bit direct destination with the rules below. Colours are 8 bits per component, taken from
the high byte of each 16-bit QuickDraw component.

### 8.2 The drawing pipeline

Every shape is converted to the exact set of pixels QuickDraw would touch: a **region** (§9). That region is then:

1. intersected with the canvas and the mapped clip;
2. painted through a pattern and a transfer mode (§10).

Bitmaps go through CopyBits (§11) and text through the character generator (§12), which itself ends in CopyBits.

### 8.3 Verbs

| Verb | Region | Pattern | Mode |
|---|---|---|---|
| frame (+0) | the shape's outline, drawn with the pen (§9) | pen pattern | pen mode |
| paint (+1) | the shape | pen pattern | pen mode |
| erase (+2) | the shape | background pattern | patCopy |
| invert (+3) | the shape | black | patXor, or hilite when pending (§10.5) |
| fill (+4) | the shape | fill pattern | patCopy |

Details:

- **"Same" opcodes** reuse the last rect (shared by rects, round rects, ovals and arcs), the last polygon or the last
  region, each kept in picture coordinates.
- **Rect-based shapes** map the rect, then draw nothing if the mapped rect is empty.
- **Polygons with fewer than two points** draw nothing.
- **Framing a polygon** draws a line (§9.5) between each pair of consecutive vertices and **does not close it**.
- **Pen modes on ovals, round rects and arcs** (ROM, DrawArc `$FFC93E8C`; Mac OS 9 the same): frame and paint force
  bit 3 of the pen mode and draw only modes 8–15, 40–47 and 58 (hilite). Any other mode draws **nothing**: 16–31,
  48–57 (including grayishTextOr), 59–63, and 64 and up (ditherCopy). Elsewhere ditherCopy is treated as copy.
- **HiliteMode** applies to the next drawing operation only. Every drawing operation clears it, whether or not it
  used it.

---

## 9. Shapes

All shapes produce regions in canvas coordinates, clipped horizontally to the shape's rect where noted.

### 9.1 Rects and regions

- **Rect:** its pixels.
- **Frame of a rect or region:** the shape minus the shape inset by the pen. Inset a region by (penH, penV) as
  follows:
  - shrink every span by penH at both ends, dropping spans that vanish;
  - then erode the result vertically by penV (a pixel stays only if the pixels penV above and below it are also
    inside).

### 9.2 Ovals, round rects and arcs (ROM, DrawArc)

One scan converter handles all three:

- an **ellipse** of `ovalWidth × ovalHeight` — the whole rect for ovals and arcs, the corner oval (OvSize, **not
  halved**) for round rects;
- stepped one scan line at a time from the rect's top;
- its left and right edges kept in 16.16 and moved in **half-pixel** steps.

Edges are exact only with this incremental method; there is no closed form that reproduces them.

**Ellipse setup** for rect (top, left, bottom, right):

```
w = clamp(ovalWidth, 0, (short)(right - left))
h = clamp(ovalHeight, 0, (short)(bottom - top))
L = (left << 16) + w * 0x8000
R = (right << 16) - w * 0x8000 + 0x8000
ratio = FixRatio(h, w)                      // truncating
term  = (long)ratio * ratio                  // 64-bit, 32.32
step  = 2 * term
sum   = 0
oddY  = (short)(1 - h)
target = 2*h - 1
```

**Per scan line** (only for rows inside [top, bottom)):

```
y = oddY;  oddY = (short)(oddY + 2)
while (int)(sum >> 32) < target:  R += 0x8000; L -= 0x8000; sum += term; term += step
while (int)(sum >> 32) > target:  R -= 0x8000; L += 0x8000; term -= step; sum -= term
target -= 4 * (short)(y + 1)
row's run = [(short)(L >> 16), (short)(R >> 16))
```

Examples to test against:

- 4×4 → `[1,3) [0,4) [0,4) [1,3)`.
- 7×7 → `[2,5) [1,6) [0,7) [0,7) [0,7) [1,6) [2,5)`.
- 16×16 → `[5,11) [3,13) [2,14) [1,15) [1,15) [0,16)×6 [1,15) [1,15) [2,14) [3,13) [5,11)`.
- **Quirks:**
  - Flat ovals are vertically asymmetric: 16×3 → `[2,14) [0,16) [1,15)`.
  - Runs may extend past the rect, and are clipped to it.

**Round rects:**

- Rows in `[holdTop, holdBottom)` do not step the ellipse, so the sides stay straight. Here
  `holdTop = top + ((short)ovalHeight >> 1)` and `holdBottom = holdTop + (bottom − top) − ovalHeight` (not clamped).
- With ovalHeight ≤ 0 and ovalWidth > 0, every row is `[left + ⌊ow/2⌋, right − ⌊ow/2⌋)`.

**Frames (hollow shapes):**

- The inner ellipse uses the rect inset by the pen, `(top+penV, left+penH, bottom−penV, right−penH)`, and an oval
  size of `outer − 2 × pen` on each axis.
- If the inset rect is empty, the shape is painted solid.
- On rows inside the inner rect, draw `[outerL, innerL)` and `[innerR, outerR)`. On other rows, draw the whole outer
  run.

**Arcs:**

- Angles are in degrees, 0 = 12 o'clock, clockwise.
- A negative arcAngle is normalized to `start += arc; arc = −arc`.
- arcAngle 0 draws nothing. arcAngle ≥ 360 draws the full oval.

Two rays bound the wedge:

```
start = (short)start mod 360 (made non-negative);  stop = (start + arc) mod 360
midRow = (short)(top + bottom) >> 1;  midCol = (short)(left + right) >> 1
aspect = FixRatio((short)(right-left), (short)(bottom-top))
slope1 = FixMul(SlopeFromAngle(start), aspect);  slope2 = FixMul(SlopeFromAngle(stop), aspect)
halfH  = (u16)(bottom - top) >> 1
ray_i  = (midCol << 16) - Times(slope_i, halfH)
flag1  = start < 180 ? start - 90 : 270 - start
flag2  = stop  < 180 ? stop  - 90 : 270 - stop
```

- **Times(s, n):** the 68000 way of multiplying a Fixed by a small integer:
  - `low = (u16)s × n` (unsigned 32-bit);
  - `high = (short)((short)(s >> 16) × n)`;
  - result high word = `(u16)((low >> 16) + (u16)high)`, low word = `low & 0xFFFF`.
  - The high word wraps, so steep angles in huge ovals wrap exactly as on the Mac (e.g. 89–91° in a 1200×1200 oval).
- **Hidden top half:** with arc < 180, the top half is hidden when `(short)(flag1 | flag2) ≥ 0`. With arc = 180, it
  is hidden when start = 90.

For each row from top to bottom, first step the ellipses (outer and inner) as above. Then:

- **At midRow:** negate both flags and un-hide. If arc < 180 and `(short)(flag1 | flag2) ≥ 0`, stop, because the arc
  lay in the top half. If arc = 180 and start = 270, stop. Otherwise swap the two rays (position, slope and flag).
- **Otherwise, if not hidden:** emit the row's runs, cutting the left side at ray 1 while `flag1 < 0` and the right
  side at ray 2 while `flag2 < 0`. Ray positions are `(short)(ray >> 16)`, evaluated at the row's top.
  - `cutLeft = clip1 && outerL < ray1 ? ray1 : outerL`
  - `cutRight = clip2 && outerR > ray2 ? ray2 : outerR`
  - **Hollow rows:** `innerLeft = clip2 && innerL > ray2 ? ray2 : innerL` and
    `innerRight = clip1 && innerR < ray1 ? ray1 : innerR`.
    - If `cutLeft < cutRight`, emit `[cutLeft, innerLeft)` and `[innerRight, cutRight)`.
    - Otherwise, for a reflex wedge (`(short)(flag1 & flag2) < 0` and arc > 180):
      - if `innerLeft == cutRight`, emit `[cutLeft, innerL)`;
      - else if `cutLeft == innerRight`, emit `[innerR, cutRight)`;
      - then emit `[outerL, innerLeft)` and `[innerRight, outerR)`.
  - **Solid rows:** if `cutLeft < cutRight`, emit `[cutLeft, cutRight)`. Otherwise, for a reflex wedge, emit
    `[outerL, cutRight)` and `[cutLeft, outerR)`.
- **Then** advance both rays by their slopes.

All runs are clipped to [left, right).

### 9.3 Fill details specific to DrawArc (ROM)

- **Solid-pattern shortcut:** ovals, round rects and arcs have none. Hilite always works per pixel wherever the
  pattern pixel is not the background colour (contrast §10.5).
- **Pen modes:**
  - source modes act as the corresponding pattern modes;
  - only modes 8–15, 40–47 and 58 draw once bit 3 is forced; everything else draws nothing (§8.3).

### 9.4 Lines

The pen is a `penH × penV` rectangle **hanging below and right** of the path, swept from (h1, v1) to (h2, v2)
inclusive:

- **Bounds:** `top = min(v1, v2)`, `bottom = max(v1, v2) + penV`, `left = min(h1, h2)`, `right = max(h1, h2) + penH`.
  If this rect is empty, the line draws nothing.
- **Horizontal or vertical lines:** that rectangle.
- **Otherwise, a pen dimension ≤ 0** draws nothing.
- **Otherwise:** order the ends so v1 < v2, and emit one run per row:

```
slope = FixRatio((short)(h2 - h1), (short)(v2 - v1))
rise  = FixMul(penV << 16, slope)
runL  = (h1 << 16) + 0x8000 + (slope >> 1)
runR  = runL + (penH << 16)
if slope >= 0:  runL -= rise;  if slope < 0x10000: runL += slope  else: runR -= 0x10000
else:           runR -= rise;  if slope < -0x10000: runL += 0x10000 else: runR += slope
for row in [top, bottom):  emit [(short)(runL >> 16), (short)(runR >> 16)) clipped to [left, right); runL += slope; runR += slope
```

**Line pen mode:** a Boolean pen mode m < 32 becomes the pattern mode `(m mod 64) | 8`; other modes are used as
they are.

### 9.5 Polygons

A filled polygon is the region QuickDraw records for its edges, closed from the last point to the first:

- **Horizontal edge:** add the inversion-point pair (h1, v) and (h2, v).
- **Vertical edge:** adds nothing.
- **Any other edge** (ordered so v1 < v2):

```
slope = FixRatio((short)(h2-h1), (short)(v2-v1))
h = (h1 << 16) + 0x8000 + (slope >> 1)
if slope >= 0: { if slope < 0x10000: h += slope }
else if slope < -0x10000: h += 0x10000
prev = h1; v = v1
do { cur = (short)(h >> 16); if cur != prev: toggle points (prev, v) and (cur, v); prev = cur; v++; h += slope } while v != v2
if prev != h2: toggle (prev, v) and (h2, v)
```

Build the region from all points (a point toggled twice cancels).

## 10. Patterns and transfer modes

### 10.1 Mode numbers

| Modes | Names |
|---|---|
| 0–7 | srcCopy, srcOr, srcXor, srcBic, notSrcCopy, notSrcOr, notSrcXor, notSrcBic |
| 8–15 | patCopy, patOr, patXor, patBic, notPatCopy, notPatOr, notPatXor, notPatBic |
| 32–39 | blend, addPin, addOver, subPin, transparent, addMax, subOver, adMin |
| 40–47 | the same arithmetic modes as 32–39, with bit 3 set |
| 49 | grayishTextOr (text only, §12.6) |
| 50 | hilite (58 as a pattern mode) |
| 64 | ditherCopy (bit) |

**Normalization:**

1. Clear bit 6.
2. Modes ≥ 50 are **hilite**.
3. 49 is srcOr.
4. 32–47 become `mode & ~8`.
5. Otherwise take `mode & 7`. Pattern and source variants are the same operation for 1-bit data.
6. With **HiliteMode pending**, srcXor/patXor become hilite.

### 10.2 1-bit sources and 1-bit patterns

A 1-bit pixel (1 = "on"/black) is colorized with the foreground colour F and background colour B.

**Boolean modes** (for the `not` modes, first swap on/off):

| Mode & 3 | Result |
|---|---|
| copy | on → F, off → B |
| or | on → F, off → unchanged |
| xor | on → invert the destination (255 − each component), off → unchanged |
| bic | on → B, off → unchanged |

**Arithmetic, transparent and hilite modes** use the colorized pixel (F for on, B for off) as a colour source
(§10.4).

### 10.3 Colour sources in Boolean modes (ROM)

For a colour source pixel s (a pixel of a deep bitmap or a colour pattern) and destination d, work **bitwise on
24-bit RGB values**. The ROM's direct loops work on inverted values, which gives:

| Mode | Result |
|---|---|
| srcCopy | `(s & B) \| (~s & F)` |
| srcOr | `(~s & F) \| (s & d)` |
| srcXor | `d ^ ~s` |
| srcBic | `(~s & B) \| (s & d)` |
| notSrcCopy | `(~s & B) \| (s & F)` |
| notSrcOr | `(s & F) \| (~s & d)` |
| notSrcXor | `d ^ s` |
| notSrcBic | `(s & B) \| (~s & d)` |

With the default black foreground and white background, srcCopy copies, srcOr is an AND, and so on.

**Colour patterns (PixPat types 1 and 2) in Boolean modes** instead treat the pattern pixel P as a value with fore =
all ones and back = 0 (the `not` modes invert P first):

| Mode & 3 | Result |
|---|---|
| copy | P |
| or | `d \| P` |
| xor | `d ^ P` |
| bic | `d & ~P` |

### 10.4 Arithmetic modes (ROM, 32-bit destination)

Computed per 8-bit component, with s = source and d = destination. The weight or pin comes from the OpColor
component `w` (16-bit); a zero component counts as 1, and `pin = w >> 8`.

| Mode | Component |
|---|---|
| blend | `(s·w + d·(65536 − w)) >> 16` truncating. **Exception:** when all three weights are equal and are `$7FFF` or `$8000`, use the exact average `(s + d) >> 1`. |
| addPin | `r = s + d`; `r > 255 or r > pin ? pin : r` |
| addOver | `(s + d) & 255` |
| subPin | `r = d − s`; `r < 0 or r < pin ? pin : r` |
| subOver | `(d − s) & 255` |
| addMax | `max(s, d)` |
| adMin | `min(s, d)` |
| transparent | s, except that pixels whose RGB equals the background colour are not drawn |

### 10.5 Hilite

- A source pixel equal to the background colour is not drawn.
- Otherwise:
  - a destination pixel equal to the background colour becomes the highlight colour;
  - a destination pixel equal to the highlight colour becomes the background colour;
  - any other destination pixel is unchanged.

**ROM quirk (rects, polygons and regions filled through RgnBlt):** when the area is **not a single rectangle** and
the pattern is a 1-bit pattern whose rows are all `$00` or `$FF`, with at least one `$FF` row, hilite fills the
whole area as if the pattern were solid black. BitBlt (a single rectangle) and DrawArc (ovals, round rects, arcs) do
not do this.

### 10.6 Pattern placement

Pattern pixel for canvas pixel (x, y), where patAlign is the accumulated Origin shift (§6.4):

- **1-bit patterns:** row `(y + patAlign.v) & 7`, bit `(x + patAlign.h) & 7`.
- **Pixel patterns (ROM):** `((x + patAlign.h) mod w, y mod h)`. There is no vertical shift.

---

## 11. Bitmaps (CopyBits / StretchBits)

Bitmap opcodes transfer `srcRect` of the pixel map to the **mapped** `dstRect`:

- **Mask:** the mapped mask region (Rgn variants), intersected with the clip.
- **Mode:** the opcode's mode (bit 6, ditherCopy, is ignored).

Nothing is drawn if either rect is empty.

### 11.1 Unscaled copies

If srcRect and dstRect are the same size, each destination pixel takes the source pixel at the same offset. Source
pixels outside the bitmap's bounds are skipped (the destination is left unchanged).

### 11.2 Vertical scaling (ROM)

For each destination row, a group of source rows is merged:

```
start = (srcH > dstH && srcH % dstH == 0) ? srcH - 1 : (u16)srcH >> 1     // ROM: exact integer shrinks start at srcH-1
error = -start;  row = srcTop (relative to the bitmap's top);  k = 0
while row < bitmapHeight:
    group = [row++]; error += dstH
    while error <= 0 and row < bitmapHeight: group += row++; error += dstH
    do: dstRow[k++] = group; if k == dstH: done; error -= srcH  while error >= 0
```

- Destination rows left without a group, because the source ran out, are not drawn.
- The 1984 source always started at `srcH / 2`. The ROM's `srcH − 1` for exact integer shrinks changes which rows
  merge. For example, 6 → 2 merges {0,1,2} {3,4,5}, not {0,1} {2,3,4}.

### 11.3 Horizontal scaling

**1-bit sources** use QuickDraw's special row scalers. Destination column j takes source column(s):

| dst/src | Rule |
|---|---|
| ×2, ×4, ×8, ×16 | `j / n` |
| ×1.5 | per source pair a, b: **a b b** (so abcd → abbcdd), i.e. `2·(j/3) + (j mod 3 ≠ 0)` |
| ×3, ×6 | `j / n` |
| any whole multiple of 8 | `j / n` |
| other enlargements | `((f >> 1) + j·f) >> 16` with `f = FixRatio(srcW, dstW) & 0xFFFF` |
| ×½, ×¼ | OR of source columns `2j, 2j+1` / `4j … 4j+3` |
| ×¾ | per 4 source columns a b c d: **a, b\|c, d** |
| other shrinks | source column i lands on `((f >> 1) + i·f) >> 16` with `f = FixRatio(dstW, srcW) & 0xFFFF`; the columns landing on one destination column are ORed |

- The ratio is identified by `FixRatio(srcW, dstW) & 0xFFFF` for enlargements: `$8000`, `$4000`, `$2000`, `$1000`,
  `$AAAA`, `$5555`, `$2AAA`.
- For shrinks it is `FixRatio(dstW, srcW) & 0xFFFF`: `$8000`, `$4000`, `$C000`.
- **Merged 1-bit pixels are ORed:** black wins, over both merged rows and merged columns.

Scaled 1-bit copies read source memory the way StretchBits' row buffer does. Each source row is read linearly from
srcRect's left for `32 × ceil(srcW / 32)` bits:

- bits past srcRect's right edge (up to the long boundary) come from the row's bytes;
- a row that runs past the end of the data reads as 0.

Unscaled copies read only pixels inside the bitmap.

**Deeper sources (ROM)** use the plain fraction stepper for every ratio. There are no special cases, so ×1.5 is
*not* abbcdd:

- **Enlarging:** destination j copies source `((f >> 1) + j·f) >> 16`, with `f = FixRatio(srcW, dstW) & 0xFFFF`.
- **Shrinking:** source i lands on `((f >> 1) + i·f) >> 16`, with `f = FixRatio(dstW, srcW) & 0xFFFF`.

### 11.4 Merging deep pixels (ROM)

Merging happens **at the source depth, before colour conversion**: rows first (per column), then columns.

- **2–8 bits:** the **largest pixel index** in the group. This is not an average.
- **16 and 32 bits:** a truncated per-component average.
  - First, each column's rows are averaged: `sum / n`.
  - Then the columns: `sum >> 1` for two columns, else `sum / columns`.
  - 16-bit components are averaged as 5-bit values, then expanded `(c << 3) | (c >> 2)`.

### 11.5 Colour conversion and modes

- **1-bit sources with the white/black palette** are colorized with F/B (§10.2).
- **Other indexed pixels** take their ColorTable colour.
- **16-bit pixels** expand 5 → 8 bits.
- **32-bit pixels** use their R, G, B.

The colour is then transferred with §10.3 (Boolean modes) or §10.4/§10.5 (arithmetic, transparent, hilite).

### 11.6 Alpha

- QuickDraw ignores alpha.
- A decoder that wants to keep it can store the source's alpha byte for a 32-bit, cmpCount-4 source copied with
  **srcCopy**.
- **ROM rule:** alpha survives only for **unmerged** pixels. Any pixel formed by averaging rows or columns gets alpha
  0.

---

## 12. Text

Text in a picture is **not** stored as pixels. It is a font number, size, style and mode, then characters in Mac
Roman. Reproducing it exactly needs the Macintosh bitmap fonts the picture used. These are Apple resources that the
caller must supply; they are not part of the format. Text in fonts that are not available can only be approximated,
by rendering an outline font at the same position.

### 12.1 Font resources

**`FONT` / `NFNT`** (a bitmap strike; both have the same layout):

| Offset | Type | Field |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | u16 | fontType. Bit 0: has a glyph height table. Bit 1: has a glyph width table. Bits 2–4: log₂ depth (colour fonts). Bit 9: colour. |
| 2 | i16 | firstChar |
| 4 | i16 | lastChar |
| 6 | i16 | widMax |
| 8 | i16 | kernMax (≤ 0 when glyphs kern left) |
| 10 | i16 | nDescent. **When ≥ 0, it is the high word of owTLoc** (ROM). |
| 12 | i16 | fRectWidth |
| 14 | i16 | fRectHeight: the strike's height, ascent + descent |
| 16 | u16 | owTLoc: offset **in words**, from this field, to the offset/width table |
| 18 | i16 | ascent |
| 20 | i16 | descent |
| 22 | i16 | leading |
| 24 | i16 | rowWords: the strike's row length in words |
| 26 | — | strike: `rowWords × 2 × fRectHeight` bytes, 1 bit per pixel, MSB first |
| — | u16[] | location table: `lastChar − firstChar + 3` entries (the characters, the missing symbol, a sentinel); glyph k occupies strike columns `[loc[k], loc[k+1])` |
| 16 + 2·owTLoc | i16[] | offset/width table, same count. Each entry is `offset << 8 \| width`, or **−1 for a missing character**. `offset` is the image's shift relative to kernMax; `width` is the advance. |
| — | u16[] | optional glyph-width table (fontType bit 1): 8.8 fixed widths |
| — | u16[] | optional height table (fontType bit 0): `top << 8 \| rows` per glyph |

Character c uses table slot `c − firstChar`. Characters outside [firstChar, lastChar], or with an offset/width of
−1, use the **missing symbol**, slot `lastChar − firstChar + 1`.

**`FOND`** (a font family):

| Offset | Type | Field |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | u16 | ffFlags. Bit 12: use the family's style-extra table even without fractional widths. Bit 13: **never** use it. Bit 14: ignore the family width tables. |
| 2 | u16 | ffFamID |
| 4 | i16 | ffFirstChar |
| 6 | i16 | ffLastChar |
| 8–15 | | ascent, descent, leading, widMax |
| 16 | u32 | ffWTabOff: offset of the family width tables (0 = none) |
| 20 | u32 | ffKernOff |
| 24 | u32 | ffStylOff |
| 28 | u16[9] | ffProperty: style extra widths, 4.12 per point. [0] plain, then one per style bit (bold, italic, underline, outline, shadow, condense, extend), [8] unused. Words `$8000–$8FFF` are **sign-magnitude** negatives (−(w & `$0FFF`)). |
| 46 | u16[2] | ffIntl |
| 50 | u16 | ffVersion |
| 52 | u16 | association count − 1 |
| 54 | 6 bytes each | association entries: `u16 size, u16 style, u16 resource id` |

- In an association entry, **size 0** means an outline (TrueType `sfnt`) font.
- A style with a non-zero high byte is a colour/depth variant; ignore it for 1-bit text.
- **Width tables** (at ffWTabOff):
  - u16 count − 1;
  - then per table: a u16 style, then `ffLastChar − ffFirstChar + 3` words (4.12 per point).
  - Tables are stepped with the family's own range. A FOND whose ffLastChar is 0 has none.

### 12.2 Resource forks

To load fonts from a suitcase, System file or application, parse its resource fork.

**Header:**

| Offset | Type | Field |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | u32 | dataOffset |
| 4 | u32 | mapOffset |
| 8 | u32 | data length |
| 12 | u32 | map length |

**Map** (at mapOffset):

- `+24` u16: offset of the type list, relative to the map.
- `+26` u16: offset of the name list, relative to the map.
- **Type list:** u16 count − 1; then per type: a 4-char type, u16 count − 1, and a u16 offset of its reference list
  (relative to the type list).
- **Reference entries** (12 bytes each):
  - i16 id;
  - u16 name offset (`$FFFF` = none), relative to the name list;
  - u8 attributes;
  - u24 data offset, relative to dataOffset;
  - u32 reserved.
- **Data** at the data offset: a u32 length, then the bytes.
- **Names** are Pascal strings.

A FOND resource's **name is the family name**. An old-style `FONT` numbered `family × 128 + 0` holds the family name
of old-style fonts.

### 12.3 Choosing a font (Font Manager, ROM)

**Inputs:**

- family (TxFont, after font-name mapping, §12.7);
- size (TxSize; 0 means 12);
- face (TxFace);
- the text ratio numer/denom (§12.7);
- the space extra;
- the fractional-widths and scaling-disabled flags (glyphState).

The screen is 80 × 80 dpi to the Font Manager, a ratio of 1.

**1. Size to search for:**

```
searchSize = FixRound(FixMul(FixRatio(numer.h, denom.h), size << 16))
```

Only the horizontal ratio is used.

**2. Families to try, in order:**

- The family itself. Family 0 is the **system font**; family 1 is the **application font** (normally 3, Geneva).
- Then fallbacks:
  - for families ≥ `$4000`: the system font, then the application font;
  - otherwise: the application font, Geneva (3), then the system font.

**3. For a family with a FOND** (its association entries):

1. **Exact:** entries of `searchSize`. Choose the style variant (below) and load its resource: `NFNT` of that id
   first, then `FONT`. If it loads, done. If it is missing, go on.
2. **Outline:** if the table has **any size-0 entry**, the family is TrueType. Stop, and render the text with the
   outline fallback. Double and half sizes are never tried.
3. **Double**, then **half** (only if searchSize is even): same as exact. **Skipped when scaling is disabled.**
4. **Nearest:** scan the entries in table order, skipping a leading size-0 entry, and keep the entry whose distance
   `|searchSize − size|` is **≤** the best so far, so later entries win ties (in an ascending table, ties go to the
   larger size). Sizes are taken from the table **whether or not their resource exists**.
   - **Scaling disabled:** stop at the first larger size once a smaller one has been kept. The result is the nearest
     smaller size, and a larger size only when no smaller one exists.
   - If the winner's resource is missing, the FOND search fails (step 4 below); the next-nearest size is not tried.

**Style variant within a size:**

- The entry whose style equals face wins.
- Otherwise score each entry:
  - an entry with any style bit **not** in face scores −1;
  - a subset scores the sum of **bold 4, italic 8, underline 1, outline 3, shadow 3, condense 2, extend 1**.
- The strictly highest score wins; among equal scores, the first.

The **remaining style**, the part the Font Manager must synthesize, is `face & ~entryStyle`.

**4. Old-style fonts** (the FOND search failed or there is no FOND; only families < `$200`):

- `s = (searchSize == 0 ? 1 : searchSize) & $7F`.
- Try `FONT` id `family × 128 + t` for t = s; then 2s (if s < 64); then s/2 (if s is even); then s+1 … 127; then
  s−1 … 1. **With scaling disabled, the downward scan comes first:** s−1 … 1, then s+1 … 127.
- A `FONT` shorter than `$24` bytes counts as missing.
- The remaining style is the whole face.

If nothing is found in any family, the text goes to the outline fallback.

### 12.4 Font Manager output (ROM)

**Style effects,** from the remaining style, added as bytes:

| Bit | boldPixels | italic | shadow | extra |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| bold | +1 | | | +1 |
| italic | | +8 | | |
| outline | | | +1 | +1 |
| shadow | | | +2 | +2 |
| condense | | | | −1 |
| extend | | | | +1 |

Underline sets `ulThick = 1`. Outline + shadow gives shadow 3.

**Remaining stretch,** per axis:

```
ratio  = FixMul(FixRatio(numer.x, denom.x), FixRatio(size, actualSize & $7F))
FOutNumer.x = (ratio + $80) >> 8          // 8.8, rounded half up
FOutDenom   = ($100, $100)
```

Here `size` is the requested TxSize (0 → 12) and `actualSize` the chosen strike's size. The strike is drawn
unscaled, then the whole text image is stretched by FOutNumer/FOutDenom (§12.5).

**Scaling disabled** (glyphState byte 4). Each axis's FOutNumer n is cut, and the rest becomes a factor (**ROM**):

```
numer = $100
while n >= $200: numer <<= 1; n >>= 1          // 16-bit words
while n <  $C0:  numer >>= 1; n <<= 1
if n < $100:     numer = (short)(numer * 3) >> 2; n = (n << 2) / 3     // 3/4 of a power of two
FOutNumer = numer;  factor = n << 8            // Fixed, 1.0 ≤ factor < 2.0
```

- The ROM never returns when n is 0 or ≥ `$8000` (the loops cannot end). A decoder must stop there; ClassicMac.Graphics
  leaves the stretch uncut.
- The horizontal factor multiplies every non-zero width **after** its style extra: `FixMul(width, hFactor)`, skipped
  when the factor is exactly 1.0. The space extra is added afterwards and is not scaled.
- Metrics: ascent, descent and leading (vertical factor) and widMax (horizontal) become
  `FixRound(FixMul(sign-extended byte << 16, factor))`, stored as bytes.

**Family style extra:**

- Applies to fonts found through a FOND when ffFlags bit 13 is clear and either bit 12 is set or fractional widths
  are on.
- `sum = ffProperty[0] + Σ ffProperty[bit + 1]` over the remaining style bits, leaving out bits the chosen family
  width table already covers. Then `extraFixed = FixMul(sum << 4, actualSize << 16)`.
- Fractional widths **off:** `extra = FixRound(extraFixed)`, and widths add `extra << 16`.
- Fractional widths **on:** widths add `extraFixed`, and the `extra` byte stays as in the style table.

**Width table** (Fixed, 256 entries):

- **Fractional widths off:**
  - `width = offset/width low byte`;
  - missing characters (outside the range or −1) take the missing symbol's width.
- **Fractional widths on, strike with a glyph-width table:** those 8.8 widths (`<< 8`). A word of `$FFFF` means
  missing and takes the missing symbol's word.
- **Fractional widths on, family width table** (FOND flags bit 14 clear, no strike widths):
  - Choose the table whose style equals face exactly. Otherwise take the best subset, scoring **bold 1, italic 3,
    underline 5, outline 4, shadow 4, condense 2, extend 2**.
  - **ROM:** the table's words are read from its start for the **strike's** range, word k → character
    `strikeFirst + k`. When the strike's first character differs from the family's, the widths are shifted.
  - The missing symbol's width is word `strikeLast − strikeFirst + 1`, and a word of `$FFFF` means missing.
  - Width = `(u16 word × actualSize) << 4`.
  - Characters outside the strike's range take the missing width.

Then, for all three sources:

- **Every non-zero width** gets the style extra. Zero widths get none. The missing symbol's width gets it too.
- **Space:**
  `widths[32] += FixMul(FixMul(FixRatio(numer.h, denom.h), FixRatio(FOutDenom.h, FOutNumer.h)), spaceExtra)`.
- `widths[13]` (return) = 0.

**Metrics** (GetFontInfo, used by grayishTextOr):

- ascent/descent are the strike's (bytes), scaled as above when scaling is disabled.
- With shadow: +1 ascent, + shadow descent.
- If FOutNumer ≠ FOutDenom, each is scaled `(v · numer.v + denom.v / 2) / denom.v`.

### 12.5 Drawing text (DrText, ROM)

**Input:** the pen at (h, v) plus a fraction `frac` (16 bits), the text, the Font Manager output, the mode, and the
character extra `cx` (Fixed, §12.7).

**1. Character extra in strike pixels** (if non-zero):

```
cx = FixMul(FixMul(cx, size << 16), FixMul(FixRatio(numer.h, denom.h), FixRatio(FOutDenom.h, FOutNumer.h)))
```

**2. Width.**

- `width = Σ widths[c] + (c ≠ 32 ? cx : 0)`, as Fixed.
- **Code 32 is always a space.** Its glyph is never drawn, and it never gets cx.

**3. Mode.**

- `mode = txMode & ~8`: the pattern bit only; there is no `& 7`.
- If bit 6 is set, the text image is also the transfer **mask**, so only glyph pixels are touched, and bit 6 is
  cleared.
- Arithmetic and hilite modes reach the transfer as they are.

**4. textRect.**

- **left** = `h + kern`:
  - `kern` is 0 unless kernMax < 0.
  - When kernMax < 0: look up the offset/width entry of the **first character by its raw character code**, not
    `code − firstChar` (**ROM bug**). If that entry is −1, use entry 0 instead.
  - `kern = min(0, (entry >> 8 & $FF) + kernMax)`, applied only when that sum ≤ 0.
- **right** = the high word of `((h << 16) | frac) + width`, **with no extra slop**. Ink past the final pen
  position is clipped.
- **If the remaining style is non-zero:**
  - `lean = (short)((u16)(sign-extended italic byte) × (u16)(ascent − 1)) >> 4`
  - `slop = (sbyte)(lean + bold − extra)` — summed in a **byte**, so it wraps above 127
  - `right += slop + (shadow == 0 ? 0 : shadow < 4 ? shadow + 1 : 4)`
  - `left −= (short)((u8)italic × (u16)descent) >> 4`
- **top** = `v − ascent`; **bottom** = `top + fRectHeight`. These are the strike's ascent and fRectHeight.

**5. Stretch.**

- When FOutNumer ≠ FOutDenom, the pen advances by `width × numer.h / denom.h` (unsigned, truncated).
- The image goes to `MapRect(textRect, (v, h, v + denom.v, h + denom.h), (v, h, v + numer.v, h + numer.h))`.
- **New pen fraction:** `(frac + advance) & $FFFF`.

**6. Buffer.**

- A 1-bit off-screen image with its left edge at `bufLeft = left & ~31` (the long-aligned pixel at or left of it).
- It is `rowLongs = ((u16)(right − bufLeft) >> 5) + 2` longs wide and fRectHeight rows tall, cleared to 0.
- One extra long follows it.
- Treat the image as **one bit stream**, rows back to back. Glyph writes and style passes that cross a row edge
  flow into the neighbouring row.

**7. Characters.**

- `charLoc = ((h + kernMax − bufLeft) << 16) | frac`. The ROM starts at the pen's own fraction; the 1985 code always
  used ½.
- For each byte:
  - **Space (32):** `charLoc += widths[32]`.
  - **Otherwise:** `step = widths[c] + cx`. Find the glyph: slot `(u16)(c − firstChar)`; if that is past the range
    or −1, use the missing symbol. If the missing symbol is also −1, skip the character **without advancing**.
  - Draw at `x = (entry >> 8 & $FF) + (short)(charLoc >> 16)`, then `charLoc += step`.
  - The glyph's strike columns `[loc[k], loc[k+1])` (skip if empty) are **ORed** into the image at x, for rows
    `[top, top + rows)` of the height table (default: all rows).

**8. Styles,** in this order:

1. **Bold:** `boldPixels` passes. Each pass ORs every bit of the stream into the next bit (right by one; the last bit
   of a row carries into the next row), over the image plus the extra long.
2. **Italic:** working upward from the second-to-last row, keep an accumulator (`+= italic` per row, **not
   wrapped**). Each row takes the bits `acc >> 4` positions to its left in the stream; bits before the image read 0.
   The bottom row does not move.
3. **Underline** (ulThick ≠ 0 and descent ≥ 2):
   - `ink = row B | row B+1 | row B+2`, where B = ascent is the baseline row, and B+2 := B when descent = 2.
   - Spread `ink` one pixel left and right.
   - Row `B+1 |= ~spread` across the **whole** image row. There is no right trim; it runs to textRect's right edge,
     including the slop.
4. **Shadow / outline** (shadow ≠ 0; a **colour port**):
   - `buf2` = the image followed by 4 zero rows.
   - Smear buf2 right `(shadow & 3) + 1` times over the image's bits plus one long (bits can spill into the first
     extra row).
   - Smear it down the same number of times over all rows (each row |= the row above, from the bottom up).
   - Then XOR the image **one bit later and one row lower** into buf2: `buf2[W + j] ^= image[j − 1]` for j over the
     image plus one long.
   - Transfer buf2 from `(top, left, bottom + 4, right)` to that rect offset by (−1, −1) (mapped if stretched).
   - **Nothing else is drawn.** The letters' inside is left untouched, so outline text shows the background through
     it. (A black-and-white port would refill the inside for srcOr/srcBic.)

**9. Transfer.** Without shadow, transfer the image's textRect to the stretched rect with the mode. The image is a
1-bit bitmap with bounds `(top, bufLeft, bottom, right)`, so the scaling rules of §11 apply.

### 12.6 grayishTextOr (mode 49)

Pictures never record it, because it is drawn outside picture recording, but a hand-built picture may use it. On a
colour port:

1. Take the foreground and background as 16-bit colours `c·257`.
2. `mid = (fg + bk) >> 1` per component, `+2` if `< $8000`.
3. `gray` = the high byte of mid.
4. If `dist(gray·257, mid)` is less than half of `dist(gray·257, bk)` and less than half of `dist(gray·257, fg)`,
   where `dist` is the largest component difference, draw the text srcOr in `gray`.
5. Otherwise draw it srcOr in the foreground colour, then paint the rect `(v − ascent, h, v + descent, h + width)`
   with the **gray pattern** (`AA 55 AA 55 …`) in **patBic**:
   - ascent and descent are the metrics of §12.4;
   - width is the unscaled integer width from step 2 of §12.5.

### 12.7 Text opcodes (ROM)

- **LongText, DHText, DVText, DHDVText:**
  - Set or move the text location (picture coordinates). The location persists between text opcodes.
  - The pen goes to the mapped location:
    - **version 2:** MapFixPt (§6.6) of `(v + ½, h + pendingFrac)`. The pen is the integer parts, and the pen
      fraction becomes h's fraction.
    - **version 1:** MapPt. The pen fraction keeps whatever the previous text left.
  - pendingFrac resets to ½ at every text opcode.
- **PnLocHFrac:** sets pendingFrac for the **next** text opcode only.
- **ChExtra:** stored as it is (4.12 per point). **LineJustify:** `interCharSpacing` (Fixed per point) is stored.
  The character extra of §12.5 is `(ChExtra << 4) + interCharSpacing`, scaled there.
- **SpExtra:** the space extra (Fixed), scaled by the Font Manager (§12.4).
- **glyphState:** the third byte turns fractional widths on or off, and the fourth turns scaling off or on (§12.3,
  §12.4).
- **TxRatio:**

  ```
  numer.v' = numer.v × toRect.height;  denom.v' = denom.v × fromRect.height     (u16 × u16)
  while ((numer.v' | denom.v') & 0xFFFF8000) != 0: numer.v' >>= 1; denom.v' >>= 1
  (the same for h with widths)
  ```

  This replaces the text ratio. Initially the ratio is numer = toRect size, denom = fromRect size.
- **fontName:**
  - Look up the family with that name, as GetFNum does.
  - If it exists, is not family 0, and differs from the picture's number, then **later** TxFont opcodes with the
    picture's number select the named family. The first mapping for a number wins.
  - Recorders write fontName **before** its TxFont.
- **TxMode / TxSize / TxFace / TxFont** are stored as they are.

### 12.8 Outline fallback

When no bitmap strike can be used (no fonts supplied, the family is missing, or it is TrueType), render the text with
an outline font:

- at the mapped pen position, with the baseline at v;
- at TxSize, with TxFace;
- through the text mode as a 1-bit mask.

The picture's font name, if known from a fontName opcode, helps choose a similar font. This cannot match a Macintosh
exactly.

## 13. QuickTime images

### 13.1 CompressedQuickTime (0x8200)

After the u32 length:

| Type | Field |
|---|---|
| u16 | version |
| i32[9] | matrix `a b u c d v h vOff w`: a, b, c, d, h, vOff are 16.16; u, v, w are 2.30 |
| u32 | matteSize |
| Rect | matteRect |
| u16 | transfer mode |
| Rect | srcRect |
| u32 | accuracy |
| u32 | maskSize |
| bytes | the matte (matteSize bytes; an image description + data). It may be ignored. |
| bytes | the mask Region (maskSize bytes, if non-zero) |
| — | the image description, then the compressed data up to the end of the opcode |

**Image description** (at least 86 bytes):

| Offset | Type | Field |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | u32 | idSize: total size, including a colour table and atoms |
| 4 | 4 chars | cType: the codec |
| 8 | 8 bytes | reserved |
| 16 | u16, u16 | version, revision |
| 20 | u32 | vendor |
| 24 | u32, u32 | temporal and spatial quality |
| 32 | u16, u16 | width, height |
| 36 | Fixed, Fixed | hRes, vRes |
| 44 | u32 | dataSize |
| 48 | u16 | frameCount |
| 50 | 32 bytes | name (Pascal string) |
| 82 | i16 | depth: 1–32; 33–40 = gray 1–8 bits |
| 84 | i16 | clutID: −1 = none; 0 = a ColorTable follows at offset 86 |

The compressed data starts at `idSize` (at least 86).

**Palette for indexed images:**

- clutID 0 → the table that follows (its entries' RGB high bytes);
- else the standard table of that clutID;
- else the standard table for the depth.

Standard tables:

- id 1, 2, 4, 8: the Macintosh default 1-, 2-, 4- and 8-bit colour tables;
- ids 33–40: gray ramps of 2ⁿ levels (n = id − 32), white first.
- The 8-bit table is the 6×6×6 cube of `$FF…$00` in steps of `$33` (red slowest, white first), the first 215 of
  its colours. Then 10-level red, green, blue and gray ramps (`EE DD BB AA 88 77 55 44 22 11`), then black.

**Placement:**

- Map the corners of srcRect through the matrix: `h' = x·a + y·c + h`, `v' = x·b + y·d + vOff`, then
  `(value + $8000) >> 16`.
- Draw the decoded image into their bounding box (rotation and skew are not modelled), then map that box to the
  canvas (§6).
- Use the opcode's transfer mode, and its mask region intersected with the clip.

**Fallback drawing:**

- QuickTime pictures carry a fallback for systems without QuickTime: usually "QuickTime and a … decompressor are
  needed to see this picture", sometimes a bitmap.
- When the image was decoded:
  - If the next opcode is **PnSize with v = `$00AE`**, its h is a byte count. Skip that many bytes after the opcode.
  - Also skip a bitmap opcode that immediately follows **into the same destination rect** (Photoshop's placeholder).

### 13.2 Codecs

Each codec produces an RGBA image of the description's width × height.

**`raw ` (uncompressed):**

- Rows at the description's depth (1–32; for 33–40 use depth − 32 bits of index).
- Row length: the data length / height, if that is within 3 bytes above the minimum; otherwise the minimum rounded up
  to even.
- 16-bit is RGB 555, 24-bit RGB, 32-bit ARGB.

**`rle ` (Animation):**

- **Header:** u32 chunk size, then u16 flags. If flags bit 3 is set: u16 starting line, 2 bytes, u16 line count,
  2 bytes.
- **Per line:** a skip byte (0 ends the frame; otherwise skip `skip − 1` units), then codes until −1:
  - `0`: another skip byte follows;
  - `n > 0`: n literal units follow;
  - `n < −1`: the next unit is repeated −n times.
- **Unit sizes:**

  | Depth | Unit |
  |---|---|
  | 1 bit | 16 pixels in 2 bytes |
  | 2 bits | 16 pixels in 4 bytes |
  | 4 bits | 8 pixels in 4 bytes |
  | 8 bits | 4 pixels in 4 bytes |
  | 16 | one RGB 555 pixel (2 bytes) |
  | 24 | one RGB pixel (3 bytes) |
  | 32 | one ARGB pixel (4 bytes) |

**`rpza` (Road Pizza / Apple Video):**

- **Framing:** a byte `$E1`, a u24 length, then opcodes over 4×4 blocks in raster order. Colours are RGB 555 (mask
  `$7FFF`).
- **Opcodes:**
  - `$80 + n−1`: skip n blocks.
  - `$A0 + n−1`, colour: n solid blocks.
  - `$C0 + n−1`, colour A, colour B: n four-colour blocks, each followed by 4 index bytes.
  - A byte with bit 7 clear starts a single block: with the next byte it forms colour A.
    - If the byte after that has bit 7 set, it starts colour B of a four-colour block.
    - Otherwise 15 more colours follow: a 16-colour block.
- **Four-colour blocks:**
  - The colours, by 2-bit index, are `{B, (11A + 21B) >> 5, (21A + 11B) >> 5, A}`, per 5-bit component.
  - One index byte per row, most significant pair first.

**`smc ` (Graphics):**

- **Framing:** a flags byte and u24 length, then opcodes over 4×4 blocks of 8-bit indices. There are three 256-entry
  circular caches of 2-, 4- and 8-colour sets.
- **Opcodes** (the high nibble is the operation, the low nibble `n−1`; the second of each pair takes the count from
  the next byte + 1):

  | Opcode | Operation |
  |---|---|
  | 0x/1x | skip |
  | 2x/3x | repeat the previous block |
  | 4x/5x | repeat the previous two blocks |
  | 6x/7x | one colour byte, solid blocks |
  | 8x/9x | two-colour blocks: 8x reads a new pair into the cache, 9x a cache index; then u16 flags per block, bit 15 = pixel 0 |
  | Ax/Bx | four-colour blocks: u32 flags, 2 bits per pixel, top first |
  | Cx/Dx | eight-colour blocks: 6 bytes per block, nibbles n0…nB (see below) |
  | Ex | 16 raw indices per block |

- **Eight-colour block pixel indices:** pixels 0–7 take 3-bit indices from `n0 n1 n2 n4 n5 n6`, and pixels 8–15 from
  `n8 n9 nA n3 n7 nB`, each read as a 24-bit value, most significant first.

**`cvid` (Cinepak):**

- **Frame header:** flags, u24 length, u16 width, u16 height, u16 strip count.
- **Strips:** u16 id, u16 size, then y1, x1, y2, x2. Each strip's height is `y2 − y1`, or the rest of the frame
  when that is ≤ 0.
- **Chunks:** u16 id, u16 size including the header.
- **Codebook chunks (`$20xx`):**
  - `$0200` selects the V1 book (else V4).
  - `$0400` means 4-byte entries (luma only: gray or palette index), else 6 bytes: Y0 Y1 Y2 Y3, i8 U, i8 V.
  - `$0100` is a partial update: a u32 bit mask (MSB first) precedes each 32 entries.
- **Vector chunks** cover the strip's 4×4 blocks in raster order, reading a u32 mask stream MSB first:
  - `$3000`: one bit per block; 1 = four V4 indices (2×2 each), 0 = one V1 index (its 4 lumas each fill a 2×2).
  - `$3100`: first a "changed" bit (0 = skip the block), then the V4/V1 bit.
  - `$3200`: V1 only, with no bits.
- **Colour:** `R = Y + 2V`, `G = Y − U/2 − V` (U/2 truncated toward zero), `B = Y + 2U`, clamped. For depths ≤ 8
  the Y value is a palette index; for 33–40 it is gray.

**`8BPS` (Planar RGB):**

- u16 packed byte counts for each row of each plane, then the planes' PackBits rows.
- Planes are R, G, B, then alpha for depth 32. For depth 8 there is one plane of palette indices.

**`yuv2`:** per pixel pair, `Y0 U Y1 V`, with U and V as signed bytes.

**`YVU9`:** a full Y plane, then V and U planes subsampled 4×4, unsigned and centred on 128. The colour conversion
for YUV codecs is full-range JFIF:

- `R = Y + 1.402 V`
- `G = Y − 0.344136 U − 0.714136 V`
- `B = Y + 1.772 U`

**`tga ` (Targa):** a complete Targa file:

- an 18-byte header, then the image ID, colour map and pixels;
- types 1/2/3, raw or RLE (+8);
- 8/15/16/24/32 bits;
- bottom-up unless descriptor bit 5 is set.

**`PNTG` (MacPaint):** 576 × 720, 1 bit per pixel, 72-byte rows PackBits-compressed back to back, 1 = black.

**Others** (`jpeg`, `png `, `gif `, `tiff`, …) contain a complete file in that format. Hand them to a general image
decoder. An image that cannot be decoded draws nothing, and the fallback drawing is then shown.

### 13.3 UncompressedQuickTime (0x8201)

After the u32 length:

| Type | Field |
|---|---|
| u16 | version |
| i32[9] | matrix, as in 0x8200 |
| u32 | matteSize |
| Rect | matteRect |
| bytes | the matte (matteSize bytes), then a pad byte to an even offset |
| u16 | a bitmap opcode: `0098`, `0099`, `009A` or `009B` (`0090`–`0093` read the same way) |
| — | that opcode's operands (§4.5) and pixel data (§5) |

- Draw the bitmap as that opcode would, with its own mode and mask region.
- **Placement:** with an identity matrix, the opcode's dstRect. Otherwise, as for 0x8200, the bounding box of the
  opcode's srcRect mapped through the matrix. This follows the compressed case; no Apple reference was checked.
- Afterwards, skip the fallback drawing as for 0x8200.
- A Macintosh without QuickTime skips the whole opcode (u32 length) and shows the fallback instead.

---

### 13.4 QuickTime image files (QTIF)

The standalone form of a QuickTime image (`.qtif`, `.qti`, `.qif`) is a sequence of atoms:

| Type | Field |
|---|---|
| u32 | atom size, including this 8-byte header. 0 = to the end of the file; 1 = a u64 size follows the type. |
| 4 chars | atom type |
| bytes | content |

- **`idsc`:** an image description, as in §13.1, including any colour table.
- **`idat`:** the compressed image. Decode it with the description's codec (§13.2).
- **`iicc`:** an ICC profile (optional).
- Other atoms (`meta`, …) can be ignored.
- **Detection:** the first atom's type is `idsc`, `idat` or `iicc`.

### 13.5 MacPaint documents (PNTG)

MacPaint documents (`.pntg`, `.pnt`, `.mac`; file type `PNTG`) are 576 × 720 at 1 bit per pixel, with 1 = black:

| Offset | Size | Field |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | u32 | version: 0, 2 or 3 |
| 4 | 304 | 38 fill patterns of 8 bytes (versions 2 and 3) |
| 308 | 204 | padding (zeros) |
| 512 | — | 720 rows of 72 bytes, each PackBits-compressed on its own |

- The same rows, without the 512-byte header, are the data of the QuickTime `PNTG` codec (§13.2).
- A **MacBinary** wrapper may precede the file:
  - a 128-byte header: byte 0 is 0, a 1–63 character name starts at byte 1, and the file type `PNTG` is at byte 65;
  - the data fork's length is at byte 83;
  - the data fork starts at byte 128.
- MacPaint has no magic number. For detection, check the version, the zero padding, and that the first row unpacks
  to exactly 72 bytes; the file type or extension is a stronger hint.

---

## 14. Picture comments

- **ShortComment** carries a u16 kind; **LongComment** a u16 kind, a u16 size and data.
- They do not draw. A decoder should expose them.
- **Kind 224: ICC profile.**
  - Data is a u32 selector followed by payload:
    - 0 = the first chunk;
    - 1 = a continuation;
    - 2 = end (no payload).
  - Concatenate the payloads from selector 0 through the selector-2 comment.

---

## 15. Writing pictures

A picture that every PICT reader, and the ROM, decodes identically:

1. **File header:** 512 zero bytes, for a `.pict` file only.
2. **Picture header:**
   - `u16 0` (picSize);
   - picFrame `(0, 0, H72, W72)`, the image size at 72 dpi: `round(pixels × 72 / dpi)`, at least 1;
   - `0011 02FF`, then `0C00`;
   - `FFFE 0000` (extended version 2);
   - hRes, vRes (Fixed dpi);
   - srcRect `(0, 0, height, width)`;
   - `u32 0`.
3. **Clip:** `0001`, size 10, the rect `(0, 0, height, width)`.
4. **Optional ICC profile:** LongComments of kind 224:
   - selector 0 with the first ≤ 32000 bytes;
   - selector 1 for each further chunk;
   - then selector 2 with no data.
   - Each comment starts word-aligned.
5. **The image** as one bitmap opcode per vertical strip, each word-aligned:
   - **Indexed (1, 2, 4, 8 bits):**
     - opcode `0098` (or `0090` when rowBytes < 8);
     - rowBytes = the even number of bytes holding the strip's pixels.
     - A 1-bit image whose palette is exactly {white, black} is written as a plain **BitMap** (rowBytes without bit
       15, no PixMap fields).
     - Otherwise write a PixMap (`rowBytes | $8000`, bounds, pmVersion 0, packType 0, packSize 0, hRes, vRes,
       pixelType 0, pixelSize, cmpCount 1, cmpSize = pixelSize, three zero longs), then a ColorTable (ctSeed 0,
       ctFlags 0, ctSize n−1, entries `value = i`, RGB × 257).
     - Rows: PackBits.
   - **16-bit:**
     - opcode `009A`, baseAddr `$000000FF`, rowBytes = width × 2 `| $8000`;
     - pixelType 16, pixelSize 16, cmpCount 3, cmpSize 5, **packType 3**;
     - rows PackBits over **words**. Two equal words are already worth a run.
   - **32-bit:**
     - `009A`, rowBytes = width × 4 `| $8000`;
     - pixelType 16, pixelSize 32, cmpSize 8, **packType 4**;
     - cmpCount 3 (planes R, G, B) or 4 (planes A, R, G, B);
     - each row is the planes back to back, each `width` bytes, PackBits-compressed as one line.
     - With rowBytes < 8, write unpacked `A/0, R, G, B` pixels instead.
     - **Mac OS 9 compatibility:** if any row of a strip packs into more than `(n + (n >> 7) + 3) & ~3` bytes (n =
       planes × width), Mac OS 9 misreads it (§17.1). Write that strip with **packType 1** (unpacked `A/0, R, G, B`
       rows, no byte counts) instead. Incompressible rows always exceed the limit.
   - srcRect = dstRect = the strip's bounds; mode 0 (srcCopy).
   - Each packed row is preceded by its byte count: a u8, or a u16 when rowBytes > 250.
6. **Strips:** rowBytes has only 14 bits, so a strip is at most `$3FFE` bytes wide:
   - indexed: `($3FFE × 8 / bits) & ~15` pixels;
   - 16-bit: `$3FFE / 2`;
   - 32-bit: `$3FFE / 4`.
   - Wider images are split into strips side by side, each with bounds `(0, left, height, left + w)`.
7. Word-align, then `00FF`.

**PackBits encoding:**

- A run of **3 or more** equal units, or 2 or more when packing words, is written as `(1 − count, unit)`.
- Anything else is written in literal blocks `(count − 1, units…)`. A literal block ends where a run of 3 begins.
- At most 128 units per run or block.

## 16. Not covered

Everything this document knows about but ClassicMac.Graphics does not reproduce, in one place.

**Text**
- **TrueType (`sfnt`) text.** It goes to the outline fallback. On Mac OS 9 this includes stretched text whose folded
  size has no bitmap strike (§17.4).
- **Stretched text edge cases** (§17.4): banding (a text buffer over 32 KB) and run splits restart the rounding per
  band; outline and shadow shrink the rect by 1 first.
- **The ROM's arithmetic-mode text on indexed screens** is not verified (§19.5).

**Mac OS 9 quirks found in code but not reproduced** (§17.5)
- Corrupted italic rows that need shifts of 32 bits or more.
- A clipped reduction's right-edge span that is one column short.
- A destination rect past the pixel map's bounds picking its scaling routine from truncated widths.

**Screens** (§19.6)
- Custom screen colour tables and search procs.
- QuickTime images on indexed screens, which the codecs dither themselves.

**QuickTime**
- Mattes, rotation and skew. Images are placed in their bounding box, and the matte is ignored.

**Resources** (§18)
- Icon suites: choosing a member by rect size and screen depth, and the selected, disabled, label, offline and open
  transforms, are described but not implemented. The decoders take one resource at a time.
- The 48 × 48 and 32-bit icon types (`ich#`, `il32`, `l8mk` and relatives) and `icns` are not decoded.

---

## 17. Mac OS 9 differences

Mac OS 9's native QuickDraw is a rewrite, not a port. Where it differs from sections 2–16, a picture shown on Mac OS 9
follows the rules below. It still uses the ROM's MapPt, MapRect, ScalePt, FixMul and FixRatio.

### 17.1 Picture playback

- **LineJustify (`$2D`)** is skipped. The inter-character spacing stays 0 for the whole picture.
- **Text positions (MapFixPt):** each axis multiplies by the truncated ratio `(toSize << 16) / fromSize`, rounding
  half up and saturating: `(d × ratio + $8000) >> 16`. The ROM divides exactly. For example, with a 3 → 1 scale, h = 3.0
  maps to 0.99998, so the pen is 0 with fraction `$FFFF`, not 1.0.
- **Origin** does not shift the pattern alignment, so patterns stay fixed to the canvas.
- **`$92`/`$93`** are reserved (a word length and data). Only `$90`, `$91` and `$98`–`$9B` draw.
- **Colour tables** are read whenever pixelSize < 9, whatever the opcode, including for a direct opcode and for
  pixel patterns.
- **PixPat types:** 1 and 3 are pixel maps; every other type is an RGB colour.
- **Direct pixel data, packType 0:** 32-bit maps take the 3-byte path, and 16-bit maps are word PackBits (the ROM bug
  is fixed).
- **PackBits:** a flag of `$80` (−128) is a run of 129 copies of the next unit. It is never a no-op.
- **Round rects:** the corner size is clamped to `[0, rect size]` on each axis, and a zero width or height draws a
  plain rect.
- **Component planes (packType 4)** are read through Mac OS 9's own buffers:
  - Always 3 planes, landing on pixel bytes 1–3, unless cmpCount is 4 (then 4 planes, bytes 0–3).
  - Unpacked length per row: `n = rowBytes − rowBytes/4`, or `rowBytes` with 4 planes.
  - The packed-row buffer holds only `P = (n + (n >> 7) + 3) & ~3` bytes. The unpack buffer follows it directly in
    one block that is kept for the whole image.
  - Model it as one array `mem` of `P + n` bytes. Copy each row's packed bytes to `mem[0…]`; a long row spills past
    P. Then unpack, reading `mem[src++]` and writing `mem[P + dst++]` until n bytes are out (`$80` = run of 129).
  - A row packed into more than P bytes therefore reads spilled bytes that its own output has already overwritten.
    For example, a 97-byte row of 96 literals ends with its first output byte, so pixel 31's blue takes pixel 0's
    red. The ROM reads such rows correctly.

### 17.2 Bitmaps

- **Scaling:** one DDA for rows **and** columns, at every depth, replacing the ROM's row DDA, column stepper and
  1-bit special cases:
  - Enlarging: destination k takes source `ceil(s(2k + 1) / 2d) − 1`.
  - Reducing: destination k merges the sources between `b(k−1)` and `b(k)`, with `b(k) = floor((k + 1) s / d + ½)`
    and `b(−1) = 0`.
  - Exact integer reductions agree with the ROM; other ratios do not. For example, 3 → 4 gives 0, 1, 1, 2 (ROM
    0, 0, 1, 2), a 1-bit ×1.5 gives aabccd, and 3 → 269 maps column 179 to source 2.
- **Clipped scaling:** the DDA starts at the first visible row or column n (the top or left of the visible area)
  without stepping to it. Where its error is exactly 0 there, that one row or column is off:
  - enlarging, when `s(2n + 1)` is a multiple of `2d`: it takes source `s(2n + 1) / 2d`, one more than unclipped;
  - reducing, when `2ns` is an odd multiple of `d`: its group starts one source earlier.
  - Later rows and columns are unchanged.
- **Merging:** 1–8 bits take the largest index (1 bit: OR). 16/32 bits widen 16-bit components to 8 bits, then
  average rows and then columns **rounded**: `(sum + n/2) / n`.
- **Colorizing** applies:
  - to copy modes when the foreground isn't black or the background isn't white;
  - to or modes when the foreground isn't black;
  - to bic modes when the background isn't white;
  - never to xor modes.
- **How a colorized pixel is computed:**
  - 1-bit sources and indexed srcCopy / notSrcCopy work as in the ROM (bitwise).
  - srcOr, srcBic, notSrcOr and notSrcBic, and colorizing copies of direct sources, **blend each channel**. With s
    the source channel (8-bit), `C` = fore (or modes) or back (bic modes), and `s := 255 − s` for the not modes:
    - copy: `((256 − s)·F + (s + 1)·B) >> 8`
    - notCopy: `((256 − s)·B + (s + 1)·F) >> 8`
    - or / bic: `((256 − s)·C + (s + 1)·d) >> 8`
- **Blend:** `(s·w + d·(65536 − w) + $8000) >> 16`. The exact average `(s + d) >> 1` is used when all three
  weights lie in `$7F80…$807F`; a zero weight counts as 1.
- **Pattern hilite:** follows the pattern everywhere. There is none of the ROM's whole-area quirk.
- **Pixel patterns:** use the vertical alignment too, which is always 0, since Origin does not move it.

### 17.3 Shapes

- **Arc slopes** use a half-up fixed multiply, `(a·b + $8000) >> 16`. This rarely moves an arc edge by one pixel.
  Every other arc computation is the same as the ROM.
- **Pen modes:** bit 6 is dropped first (64–79 draw as 0–15), then the same acceptance rule as the ROM applies
  (§8.3).
- **Frames of ovals, round rects and arcs** have no emptiness or pen-size test:
  - The inner shape spans rows `[top + penV, bottom − penV)`, with an oval of `max(0, ovalW − 2penH)` by
    `max(0, ovalH − 2penV)`.
  - At zero inner width (always when the pen is wider than half the shape), its edges stay fixed at
    `iL = left + penH` and `iR = right − penH`.
  - Inner rows draw two slabs, `[oL, iL)` and then `[iR, oR)`, clamped to the rect. When `iL > iR` the slabs
    overlap and the overlap is painted **twice**: copy modes are unchanged, XOR cancels, and arithmetic modes apply
    twice. Narrow rows can paint outside the oval.
  - A zero pen height makes every row an inner row. For example, a 2×8 oval framed with pen (v 0, h 2) paints
    `[0, 2)` on all 8 rows.
  - Rows outside the inner span are solid, as in the ROM.

### 17.4 Text and the Font Manager

- **Size folding:**

  ```
  if any numer/denom component is 0: numer = denom = (1, 1)
  take absolute values; if numer.v == denom.v: both 1; if numer.h == denom.h: both 1, no fold
  r = (numer.h << 16) / denom.h;  p = r·size;  if (p >> 16) < 4: no fold
  newSize = (p + $8000) >> 16;  f = FixRatio(size, newSize)
  numer = ((FixMul(f, r) + $80) >> 8, (FixMul(f, (numer.v << 16) / denom.v) + $80) >> 8);  denom = (256, 256)
  ```

  - The search uses newSize (or the original size, without folding). Size choice is otherwise as in §12.3.
  - **Stretch:** `D6 = (size << 16) / strikeSize`, then per axis `H = ratio × D6`, a half-up multiply that is
    skipped when D6 = 1.0. `FOutNumer = H ≤ $7FFF7F ? (H + $80) >> 8 : $7FFF`.
  - Examples: 9 pt at 4/3 → 12 pt, numer (256, 192); 12 pt at 3/2 → 18, (256, 171); 9 pt at 5/4 → 11, (262, 209).
- **Font fallback order:** the application font, then the lowest-numbered font family, then the system font, then
  Geneva.
- **Style variants** are matched against `face & $9B`, with the ROM's scores. The synthesized remaining style is
  the unmasked face minus the entry's style, so underline, condense and extend are always synthesized.
- **Family width tables** are walked with the family's own character range. The strike's character c takes word
  `c − ffFirstChar`, and the missing symbol takes word `ffLastChar − ffFirstChar + 1`.
- **Text modes:**
  - transparent (36) and ditherCopy (64) draw as srcOr;
  - grayishTextOr (49) draws srcOr in the gray GetGray finds (§12.6).
- **Glyph placement ignores the pen fraction.** With S the running Fixed advance from 0, a glyph goes at
  `pen.h + ((S + $8000) >> 16) + its offset + kernMax`. The pen still ends at `(pen.h << 16) + fraction + advance`,
  so PnLocHFrac only moves the end pen.
- **Italic** pivots on the row just below the baseline (y = pen.v), with `it` = the italic pixels (default 8):
  - rows above shift right by `((pen.v − y) × it) / 16`;
  - that row and the rows below shift left by `((y − pen.v + 1) × it) / 16`;
  - both divides truncate.
- **Text rect** (ink past the final pen position is not clipped), relative to the pen, starting from the union U of
  the glyph images and the spaces' origin points:
  - `W = (advance + $8000) >> 16`
  - `right = U.right`; if the mode is 0, the mode is above 3, or the text is underlined: `right = max(right, W)`
  - `right += bold + (italic ? it × (ascent − 1) / 16 − extra : 0) + (shadow ? min(shadow + 1, 4) : 0)`
  - if `extra > 0`: `right = max(right − extra, W)`
  - `left = min(U.left − (italic ? it × (descent − 1) / 16 : 0), 0)`
- **Character extra:**
  - It is added only to characters that are not spaces and have a width above 0; carriage returns and zero-width
    characters get none.
  - It is scaled with half-up multiplies.
- **A lone carriage return** (a text of exactly one byte 13) draws nothing and leaves the pen. A carriage return
  inside longer text draws its glyph with advance 0.
- **Stretched text advances the pen** by `FixMul(width, numer/denom)`, rounded half up.
- **Stretched text** has no routine of its own. The 1-bit text buffer is stretched from the text rect to the mapped
  rect, and the mapping is the same for every mode:
  - **The destination rect:** each pen-relative edge o maps to `sign(o) × floor((|o| × N + 128) / 256)`, with N the
    8.8 stretch of that axis. This is MapRect about the pen.
  - **Rows and columns:** the ordinary DDA (§17.2) on the rect sizes S → D, from the rect's own top-left:
    - enlarging, `ceil(S(2k+1)/2D) − 1`;
    - reducing, the OR of `[end(k−1), end(k))`, where `end(k) = floor((k+1)S/D + ½)`.
  - **The mode changes only the source rect.**
    - srcOr, srcXor and srcBic use the union of the glyph images. Vertically, that is the rows that hold ink, raised to
      at least the baseline; spaces count as points on the baseline.
    - srcCopy, modes above 3 and underlined text extend it to −ascent..descent and the rounded width.
    - For example, Geneva 9 text spans rows −7..2 (ink) or −10..2 (extended).
  - **Not covered:** banding (a buffer over 32 KB) and run splits restart the rounding per band. Outline and shadow
    shrink the rect by 1 first.
- **Colour bitmap fonts** (an NFNT with fontType bits 2–4 = log₂ depth > 0, strike rows `rowWords × 2 × depth` bytes;
  in a FOND the association's style high byte is the depth code):
  - At a chosen size and style, the last association of the same size and low style byte with depth code 1–4 is
    used instead of the plain strike.
  - Colours: the `fctb` with the NFNT's id (a ColorTable, §4.6), else the standard `clut` of the strike's depth.
  - Each glyph is drawn on its own with **opaque srcCopy**, whatever the text mode and style: its whole box
    (image width × font rect height, top at `pen.v − ascent`) is copied from the strike through the colours, clipped.
  - Glyph x = `HiWord(penFixed + scaled) + kernMax + offset`, where penFixed = `(pen.h << 16) | fraction`, `scaled`
    is the unscaled Fixed advance so far (widths plus chExtra, as in §12) times `numer.h / denom.h` when stretched,
    and the glyph offset is **not** scaled.
  - Stretched width = `(2 × bits × numer.h + denom.h) / (2 × denom.h)` (half up); the rows scale with MapRect about
    the pen. Glyphs of width 0 draw nothing.
  - The pen advances as for 1-bit text.

### 17.5 Not yet pinned down

These Mac OS 9 differences are known but not yet exactly specified or verified. ClassicMac.Graphics draws them the ROM way
in both modes:

- **Quirks found by reading code but not reproduced:**
  - italic rows that need shifts of 32 bits or more (from about 64 rows at the default slant) are corrupted;
  - a clipped reduction's right-edge span is one column short;
  - a destination rect past the pixel map's bounds picks its scaling routine from truncated widths.

Indexed and 16-bit screens are covered in §19. Old black-and-white ports and the destination's alpha byte do not
apply.

---

## 18. Icon, cursor and pattern resources

These are the QuickDraw image resources of classic Mac OS resource forks. They are not part of PICT, but they use
the same structures. All are big-endian.

- **1-bit images:** 1 = black. Where there is a mask, a 0 mask bit is transparent.
- **Indexed images** are converted with the high byte of each 16-bit colour component, as in PICT.

| Type | Size | Layout |
|---|---|---|
| `ICON` | 32×32 | 128 bytes, 1 bit per pixel, unmasked |
| `ICN#` | 32×32 | 128 bytes icon, then 128 bytes mask |
| `ics#` | 16×16 | 32 bytes icon, then 32 bytes mask |
| `icm#` | 16×12 | 24 bytes icon, then 24 bytes mask |
| `SICN` | 16×16 each | any number of 32-byte 1-bit icons, unmasked |
| `icl4`, `icl8` | 32×32 | 4- or 8-bit pixels in the standard colour table |
| `ics4`, `ics8` | 16×16 | 4- or 8-bit pixels in the standard colour table |
| `icm4`, `icm8` | 16×12 | 4- or 8-bit pixels in the standard colour table |
| `PAT ` | 8×8 | 8 bytes |
| `PAT#` | 8×8 each | u16 count, then 8 bytes each |
| `CURS` | 16×16 | 32 bytes data, 32 bytes mask, then the hotspot as a Point (v, h) |

**4- and 8-bit icons:**

- The standard colour tables are the Mac `clut` 4 and 8. Take their exact 16-bit values' high bytes.
- `clut` 8 is the 6×6×6 cube **without black** (215 entries, white first, red slowest), then red, green, blue and
  gray ramps of `EE DD BB AA 88 77 55 44 22 11`, then **black at 255**.
- There is no mask in the resource. The mask of the 1-bit icon list with the same id and size (`ICN#`, `ics#`,
  `icm#`) applies. Without an icon list the Icon Utilities draw nothing (noMaskFoundErr, −1000). An all-zero mask
  draws nothing.
- **An icon list without its mask half** (the resource is only the icon) gets a computed mask, CalcMask:
  - flood-fill the white pixels 4-connected to the edges;
  - the mask is every pixel the flood did not reach, which is the icon's silhouette including enclosed holes.
- **Which icon is drawn** (PlotIconID and the icon suites, Mac OS 9; described, not implemented — §16):
  - The mask group depends on the rect size:
    - 48 or more: `ich#`.
    - Under 32 and taller than 12: `ics#`, then `ICN#`, then `icm#`.
    - Under 32 otherwise: `icm#`, `ics#`, `ICN#`.
    - Otherwise: `ICN#` first.
  - The colour data comes only from the mask's group, by screen depth:
    - 16/32 bits: `il32`, `icl8`, `icl4`, `ICN#`;
    - 8 bits: `icl8`, `il32`, `icl4`, `ICN#`;
    - 4 bits: `icl4`, `ICN#`;
    - 1–2 bits: `ICN#`.
  - Plain drawing copies the data through the mask, with no transform.
  - Transforms:
    - selected: Darken halves each component, then halves the smallest, then the smaller of the other two unless they
      are equal (±$200);
    - disabled: `(c + $FFFF) >> 1`.
- **`cicn`** (PlotCIcon):
  - fore/back are forced to black/white;
  - the 1-bit BitMap is drawn if it exists and the screen depth is at most 2, else the PixMap;
  - the mask is the icon mask.

**Cursors:**

| Mask bit | Data bit | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 | black |
| 1 | 0 | white |
| 0 | 0 | transparent |
| 0 | 1 | **inverts** the screen |

**`cicn`** (colour icon):

- A header, then variable-length data:
  - a 50-byte PixMap (baseAddr, rowBytes & `$3FFF`, bounds, pmVersion, packType, packSize, hRes, vRes, pixelType,
    pixelSize, cmpCount, cmpSize, planeBytes, pmTable, pmReserved);
  - a 14-byte mask BitMap (baseAddr, rowBytes, bounds);
  - a 14-byte 1-bit BitMap (rowBytes 0 when absent);
  - a 4-byte iconData;
  - the mask bits, then the 1-bit bits;
  - a ColorTable (§4.6);
  - the pixels, unpacked, `rowBytes × height` bytes.
- The mask masks the colour pixels. Rows beyond the mask's data are unmasked.

**`crsr`** (colour cursor):

- Header:

  | Offset | Size | Field |
  |---|---|---|
  | 0 | 2 | crsrType: `$8000` monochrome, `$8001` colour |
  | 2 | 4 | offset of the PixMap |
  | 6 | 4 | offset of the pixels |
  | 10 | 10 | reserved |
  | 20 | 32 | 1-bit data |
  | 52 | 32 | mask |
  | 84 | 4 | hotspot, as a Point (v, h) |
  | 88 | 8 | reserved |

- The PixMap's pmTable is the offset of its ColorTable.
- SetCCursor **never reads the 1-bit data**. The cursor is drawn as `screen = (screen AND NOT mask) XOR image`:
  - Mask 1: the colour pixel, converted to the screen depth.
  - Mask 0 on a 16/32-bit screen: the screen is XORed with the pixel's complement. White is transparent, black
    inverts, other colours XOR their complement.
  - Mask 0 on a screen of 8 bits or fewer: the screen index is XORed with the pixel's index.
- A `CURS`'s data bit 1 under mask 0 inverts (complements) the screen.
- Hotspots are clamped to 0..15.

**`ppat`** (pixel pattern):

- Header:

  | Offset | Size | Field |
  |---|---|---|
  | 0 | 2 | patType |
  | 2 | 4 | offset of the PixMap |
  | 6 | 4 | offset of the pixels |
  | 10 | 10 | reserved |
  | 20 | 8 | the 1-bit pattern |

- The pixel data runs from the pixels offset to pmTable. A table before the pixel data makes GetPixPat fail, so the
  resource does not load. The ColorTable (at pmTable) is read unless the PixMap is RGB direct (pixelType 16).
- Types 1 and 3 decode the PixMap.
- Type 0: the pattern is the **first 8 bytes of the pixel data** (at the pixels offset), not the 1-bit pattern at
  offset 20.
- Type 2 (RGB): the colour is the ColorTable's **entry 4** (table + $2A); the resource's pixels are ignored.
  - A 32-bit screen draws it solid.
  - Other depths draw PatDither's 2×2 cell (§19).
- Mac OS 9 fails to load types above 3.
- **`ppt#`:** a u16 count, then that many u32 offsets from the resource start. Each element is a complete flattened
  `ppat`, whose own offsets are relative to the element's start; element i ends where element i+1 begins.

## 19. Screen depths

A picture drawn on a 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16-bit screen looks different. For indexed depths, QuickDraw works on colour-table
indices, and ditherCopy dithers.

- **The screen:** a GWorld of that depth with its default colour table:
  - 1 bit: white, black;
  - 2 bits: greys FFFF, ACAC, 5555, 0000;
  - 4 bits: `clut` 4;
  - 8 bits: `clut` 8;
  - 16 bits: 5-5-5 pixels, bit 15 zero.
- **Output:** each pixel is the colour of its entry. 16-bit pixels get each 5-bit field replicated to 8 bits:
  `(c << 3) | (c >> 2)`.
- Everything below is verified pixel for pixel against Mac OS 9.

### 19.1 RGB to index

**The inverse table (MakeITable, resolution 4).**

1. Take a cube of 18³ cells: a 1-cell border and 16³ interior cells.
2. Seed the entries in this order: entry 0, the last entry, then entries 1..n−1. Each seed goes to cell
   `(R8 >> 4, G8 >> 4, B8 >> 4)` + 1 on each axis.
3. The first entry to reach a cell owns it. A later entry is a hidden colour, chained to the owner.
4. Fill breadth-first from the seeds, in neighbour order +B, −B, +G, −G, +R, −R. An empty neighbour takes the
   colour and joins the queue.
5. The table is the 4096 interior cells, red most significant.

The standard `clut` 4 and 8 have no hidden colours at resolution 4.

**Grey tables** (`clut` 1 and 2) map luminance to an entry:
1. Put each entry at its red byte (the lowest index wins on equal reds).
2. Fill the gaps by alternating left-to-right and right-to-left passes, each copying a neighbour, until none is left.
   This gives the nearest entry, with exact ties going to the darker one.

**The lookups:**

| Where | Colour screens | Grey screens | 16 bits |
|---|---|---|---|
| Direct pixels copied (srcCopy, and Boolean results of direct sources) | `table[(R>>4)<<8 \| (G>>4)<<4 \| B>>4]` | `links[(5R+9G+2B) >> 4]` | `c >> 3` |
| Arithmetic and colorized results | the same | `links[(5(R&$F0) + 9(G&$F0) + 2(B&$F0)) >> 4]` (the cell's corner) | `c >> 3` |
| Color2Index (fore, back, hilite, indexed sources) | the table, then the hidden-colour chain (Mac OS 9: nearest by Manhattan distance on 16-bit components) | Mac OS 9 `links[(5R+9G+2B) >> 12]` on 16-bit components; ROM `links[((((R+G)/2 + B)/2 + R)/2 + G)/2 >> 8]` | `c16 >> 11` |

### 19.2 The port's indices

- **Fore and back:**
  - fgI = Color2Index(fore) and bkI = Color2Index(back), from the exact 16-bit colours. The classic `FgColor`/`BkColor`
    constants map to the QDColors table (§4.7).
  - On 1- and 2-bit screens, if fgI = bkI while the colours differ, fgI = Color2Index(complement of fore). For example,
    yellow on white draws black on a 1-bit screen.
- **Hilite:** hiI = Color2Index(hilite). If that equals bkI, use Color2Index of the complement instead.

### 19.3 Transfer modes on indices

Let M = 2^depth − 1 (on 16 bits, M = $7FFF). The not modes invert the source bit or source index first.

**1-bit sources and 1-bit patterns:**

| Mode | Result |
|---|---|
| copy | on → fgI, off → bkI |
| or | on → fgI |
| bic | on → bkI |
| xor | on → d ⊕ M |

**Indexed sources:**

- **copy:** `Color2Index((rgb & back) | (~rgb & fore))` on 16-bit components; notSrcCopy complements rgb first.
  - When the §19.2 collision rule replaced fgI, the fore colour here is fgI's colour.
- **or / bic / xor:** convert the source with Color2Index to s, then:
  - or: `(s & fgI) | (~s & d)`;
  - bic: `(s & bkI) | (~s & d)`;
  - xor: `d ^ s`.

**Direct sources:**
- The 32-bit rules (§10), applied to the screen colour of d.
- Then the table (Mac OS 9 colorizing included).
- On 16 bits, Mac OS 9 colorizes on 5-bit fields:
  - copy: `((32 − s)·F + (s + 1)·B) >> 5`;
  - or / bic: `((32 − s)·C + (s + 1)·d) >> 5`.

**Pixel patterns:**
- Each colour is converted to a value p: Color2Index for indexed patterns, the table for direct ones.
- Then fore = all ones and back = 0: copy p, or `d | p`, xor `d ^ p`, bic `d & ~p`.

**RGB patterns (type 2):** PatDither builds a 2×2 cell with the layout below. Pixel (x, y) takes cell
`[(y & 1) · 2 + (x & 1)]`, with the pattern alignment applied.

```
0 1
2 3
```

1. Fill the slots in the order 0, 1, 3, 2.
2. Keep running 16-bit totals, starting at 0. For each slot:
   1. Add the colour to the totals.
   2. `i = Color2Index(clamp(total, 0, $FFFF))`.
   3. Subtract Index2Color(i) from the totals.
3. Index2Color on 16 bits replicates each field: `(c << 11) | (c << 6) | (c << 1) | (c >> 4)`.

**Arithmetic modes:**
- An indexed source is first converted to its screen index, and its colour is that entry's colour.
- Apply the §10.4 operation (Mac OS 9 rounding) to the source colour and d's colour.
- Convert the result with the arithmetic lookup (§19.1).
- **16 bits:** 5-bit fields, with these rules:
  - blend: `(s·w + d·(65536 − w) + $8000) >> 16`; the average `(s + d) >> 1` only when all three weights are
    $7F80..$807F;
  - pins at the OpColor's top 5 bits;
  - addOver and subOver are modulo 32.

**transparent, hilite, invert, 1-bit screens:**
- **transparent:** writes s when s ≠ bkI.
- **hilite:** where s ≠ bkI, d = bkI becomes hiI and d = hiI becomes bkI.
- **Invert:** `d ^ M`.
- **1-bit screens:** the arithmetic modes 32–39 become srcCopy, srcBic, srcXor, srcOr, srcOr, srcBic, srcXor, srcOr,
  and hilite becomes xor.

### 19.4 ditherCopy

Only CopyBits of a direct source in srcCopy with the ditherCopy flag (64) dithers. Every other depth reduction
truncates.

**Mac OS 9:**
- **Scope:** rows of the visible bounds, starting at the top, serpentine with the first row left to right. The error
  buffer and the carry start at 0 for each call.
- **Per pixel:**
  - `v = clamp(c + carry + buf[x], 0, 255)` per component.
  - Choose the entry with the table.
  - `e = v − (the entry's 8-bit colour)`.
  - `carry = e >> 1` (floor).
  - `buf[x] = e − (e >> 1)`, stored as a signed byte, so +128 wraps.
- **Clipped pixels** reset `buf[x]` and the carry.
- **16 bits:** the error is v's low 3 bits.
- **Grey screens:** dither the luminance `(5R+9G+2B) >> 4` against the entry's blue byte.
- **1 bit:** black when v < 128, with error v or v − 255.

**ROM:**
- **Scope:** rows from the first visible one, always across the destination rect's full width. Clipped pixels are
  converted but not drawn.
- **Error split:** `buf[x] = e >> 1` (floor) and `carry = (e >> 1) + (e & 1)` (ceil), with no wrapping.
- **Grey screens:** luminance `((R + G + 2B)/4 + R + 2G)/4`, against the entry's red byte.
- **16 bits:** ordered, `min(c + D[row & 3][x & 3], 255) >> 3`, with rows counted from the first visible one and x
  from the rect's left:

  ```
  D = 0 5 1 4
      6 3 7 2
      1 4 0 5
      7 2 6 3
  ```

### 19.5 Text

- **Mac OS 9:** 1-bit text on indexed screens follows §19.3.
- **ROM synthetic strikes (2–8 bits):**
  - Glyph bits map to Color2Index(black) and to Color2Index(white), which is 0.
  - On the standard tables this gives the same pixels as expanding the 1-bit strike, so they are not modelled
    separately.
- **Not yet verified:** the ROM's arithmetic-mode text on indexed screens (colorizing stripped, ink = the black
  index).

### 19.6 Not covered

- **QuickTime images on indexed screens:** the Image Compression Manager's codecs dither to the screen themselves.
- **Custom screen colour tables and search procs.**
