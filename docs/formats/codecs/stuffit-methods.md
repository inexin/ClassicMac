# StuffIt compression methods

The compression methods StuffIt 1.x–4.x ([stuffit.md](../archives/stuffit.md)) and StuffIt 5 ([stuffit5.md](../archives/stuffit5.md)) share.

Method 6's negative-length
blocks skip Huffman coding and carry PackBits data; ClassicMac decodes those blocks in legacy and v5 archives,
including literal, repeat and no-op controls, and concatenates multiple blocks. This behavior is **[Reference]** based on
[`macutils`' method-6 decoder](https://github.com/dgilman/macutils/blob/master/macunpack/sit.c) and the
[StuffIt-Go method description](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ObsoleteMadness/StuffIt-Go/stuffit). Positive-length
blocks decode the fixed 258-leaf Huffman tree, use the block's byte translation table, stop at either end-marker
leaf, then expand the declared PackBits byte stream. Intermediate PackBits data is limited to the historical 32 KiB
method-6 buffer size. Feature tests cover both block forms separately and mixed in one fork, the legacy and v5
containers, and truncated Huffman and PackBits data.

Method 2 uses the Compress-style LZW stream: codes are least-significant-bit first, begin at 9 bits and grow to 14;
in block mode, code 256 clears the dictionary and the remainder of its eight-code group is skipped before reading
again **[Fitted]**. Decoder vectors cover dictionary reset, width growth, the full 14-bit table, the LZW next-code
case, invalid codes and declared output-length checks. The method dispatch and block-mode parameters are cross-checked
against [XADMaster's StuffIt parser](https://sources.debian.org/src/unar/1.8.1-3/XADMaster/XADStuffItParser.m/) and
[Compress decoder](https://sources.debian.org/src/unar/1.8.1-3/XADMaster/XADCompressHandle.m/); vectors are
hand-built and have not yet been checked against an archive created by the original StuffIt application.

Method 3 stores its prefix tree at the start of the compressed fork, most-significant-bit first. A `1` bit introduces
a leaf followed by its 8-bit symbol; a `0` bit introduces an internal node whose zero subtree precedes its one
subtree **[Fitted]**. The declared fork length determines how many symbols to decode. Tests cover both forks, both
branches, a truncated tree and truncated symbol data. The bitstream layout is cross-checked against
[XADMaster's StuffIt Huffman reader](https://sources.debian.org/src/unar/1.1-2/XADMaster/XADStuffItHuffmanHandle.m/);
hand-built vectors have not yet been checked against archives made by the original StuffIt application.

Method 5 is LZSS with a 4 KiB pre-seeded history window and one adaptive sibling-property Huffman tree for literals and
match lengths. Symbols 0–255 are literals; symbols 256–313 represent lengths 3–60. A match then carries a prefix code
for the upper six offset bits and six raw bits for the lower offset bits, most-significant-bit first. The window seed
and output length are independent of the fork bitstream. Tests exercise literals, the seeded space run, a maximum-
distance reference, truncated input and long forks that trigger adaptive-tree renormalization at root frequency
`0x8000`. The offset-prefix lengths are **[Fitted]** against
[macutils' method-5 decoder](https://sources.debian.org/src/macutils/2.0b3-17/macunpack/de_lzah.c/) and hand-built
fixtures; no original-application archive has yet been verified.

Method 8 is the StuffIt MW (Miller–Wegman) dictionary method. Codes are read least-significant-bit first, begin at
nine bits, and grow as the dictionary reaches powers of two. Literal codes emit one byte; later codes refer to
dictionary phrases assembled from earlier phrases. The next-free code ends a group, after which decoding restarts
with a fresh nine-bit dictionary **[Fitted]** against
[XADMaster's MW decoder](https://sources.debian.org/src/unar/1.10.8%2Bds1-9/XADStuffItOldHandles.m/) and hand-built
vectors. Tests cover phrase reconstruction, group reset, width growth and invalid/truncated input. These vectors do
not establish compatibility with files produced by the original StuffIt application.

Method 13 reads its control and Huffman-coded symbols least-significant-bit first. It supports preset code tables
and dynamically described literal/length and distance tables, followed by LZ references. Its table data is
transcribed from compcol's MIT-licensed method-13 tables (see `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`); the decoder is an independent
implementation. The CC0 StuffIt Deluxe 4.5 corpus vectors cover preset tables, dynamic tables, both forks, and exact
decoded bytes or CRC-16 checks. The corpus has aliased code alphabets; a separate hand-built vector covers distinct
literal/length trees and a distance-one back-reference. Wider validation against archives from different StuffIt
versions remains useful.

Method 14 is the block-based LZ+Huffman codec associated with StuffIt Installer Maker. A v5 fork begins with a
little-endian block count. Each block carries its compressed and expanded byte lengths, then separate 308-symbol
literal/length and 75-symbol distance trees. The tree descriptions can store lengths directly or through a recursively
described Huffman tree. Matches use a zero-initialized 256 KiB sliding window that carries across blocks. This layout
is **[Fitted]** against
[XADMaster's method-14 reader](https://sources.debian.org/src/unar/1.10.8%2Bds1-9/XADMaster/XADStuffItOldHandles.m/).
Hand-built vectors cover literals, matches, direct and recursively encoded tree lengths, multiple blocks, both forks,
and truncated block bounds; no original-application method-14 archive has yet been verified.

Method 15 begins with arithmetic-coded `As` and a block-size selector. Each block carries its randomized flag and BWT
primary index, followed by adaptive arithmetic-coded selector/MTF symbols and zero-run coding. Decoding applies the
inverse BWT, optional bit de-randomization, and the final repeat-byte RLE, then checks the stream's CRC-32. The model
parameters and range-coder behavior follow Matthew T. Russotto's published
[method-15 description](http://www.russotto.net/arseniccomp.html); the randomization table is transcribed from
compcol's MIT-licensed interoperability data (see `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`). The decoder is independently written.
Vectors use original StuffIt Deluxe 6.5.1 archives from the CC0 test corpus and assert exact data- and resource-fork
bytes, including randomized blocks. The v5 member layout and per-fork integration are **[Fitted]** against those
original-application archives.

A symbol is found from `code / (range / total)`; the last symbol owns the rest of the range (`range` less the other
symbols' share, which can exceed its `frequency × scale`), so a quotient of `total` or more selects the last symbol
rather than being invalid, as munbox's `sit15.c` (MIT) does. Without this, the DiskDoubler corpus's StuffIt 6.5.1
archives `sources.ddpro411.ad1.sit` and `ad2.sit` (fixtures `StuffIt651DiskDoublerPro411Ad1Files.sit`/`Ad2Files.sit`)
failed about 50 bits before the end of `testfile.jpg`'s and `testfile.PICT`'s streams; every file of both now expands
to the sources **[Verified]**.
