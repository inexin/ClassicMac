# Classic Mac archives

This document records the archive formats implemented by `ClassicMac.Files.Archives`. StuffIt and Compact Pro have no
published vendor specifications in the project references; rules derived from another reader or from test fixtures are
provisional and marked **[Fitted]**. An independently generated fixture proves the documented behavior, not that the
original Mac application writes every detail the same way.

## StuffIt 5 (initial subset)

StuffIt 5 is recognized by the eight-byte `StuffIt ` signature and version byte 5 at offset 82. The 100-byte archive
header stores its total length at 84, the root member count at 92, and the first root member's absolute offset at 94.
An archive member begins with `A5 A5 A5 A5`; the `u16` at +6 gives its header length. The member header has flags at +9,
Mac creation and modification seconds at +10 and +14, the next sibling offset at +22, the name byte count at +30, and
the header CRC at +32. These field positions and encodings are **[Fitted]** by comparison with
[Deark's StuffIt reader](https://github.com/jsummers/deark/blob/master/modules/stuffit.c).

The member flag `$40` denotes a folder and `$20` denotes an encrypted member **[Fitted]**. Folder headers store the
first child offset at +34 and child count at +46. A file header stores logical and compressed data-fork lengths at
+34/+38, data-fork CRC at +42, and compression method at +46. The UTF-8 name follows the fixed fields (and any
password bytes). File-specific Finder information starts after the variable header: resource-fork presence is flag bit
0 of its `flags2`; type, creator and Finder flags follow. When present, resource-fork lengths, CRC and method precede
resource bytes, which precede data-fork bytes. These member details are **[Fitted]** against Deark's independent
parser and the hand-built vectors in `StuffItFeatureTests`; they have not yet been checked against a corpus created by
the original StuffIt application.

ClassicMac currently extracts methods 0 (stored), 1 (RLE90), 2 (Compress/LZW), 3 (Huffman), 5 (LZAH) and 8 (MW) for either fork. RLE90 emits ordinary bytes as
literals; `$90 00` emits a literal `$90`; `$90 n` for nonzero `n` repeats the previously decoded byte until the run has
`n` copies **[Fitted]**. Truncated runs, runs without a prior byte, output-length mismatches and extents outside the
archive are rejected. Per-fork CRC mismatches are reported as errors while retaining the decoded file. Encrypted
entries and unsupported methods are reported and omitted; no password is requested. Files and folders are returned
through the normal `ContainerUnwrapper` pipeline, preserving UTF-8 paths, Finder type/creator/flags, dates and both
forks.

Method 2 uses the Compress-style LZW stream: codes are least-significant-bit first, begin at 9 bits and grow to 14;
in block mode, code 256 clears the dictionary and the remainder of its eight-code group is skipped before reading
again **[Fitted]**. Decoder vectors cover dictionary reset, width growth, the full 14-bit table, the LZW next-code
case, invalid codes and declared output-length checks. The method dispatch and block-mode parameters are cross-checked
against [XADMaster's StuffIt parser](https://sources.debian.org/src/unar/1.8.1-3/XADMaster/XADStuffItParser.m/) and
[Compress decoder](https://sources.debian.org/src/unar/1.8.1-3/XADMaster/XADCompressHandle.m/); vectors are
hand-built and have not yet been checked against an archive created by the original StuffIt application.

Method 3 stores its prefix tree at the start of the compressed fork, most-significant-bit first. A `1` bit introduces
a leaf followed by its 8-bit symbol; a `0` bit introduces an internal node whose zero subtree precedes its one
subtree **[Fitted]**. The declared fork length determines how many symbols to decode. Tests cover both forks, both
branches, a truncated tree and truncated symbol data. The bitstream layout is cross-checked against
[XADMaster's StuffIt Huffman reader](https://sources.debian.org/src/unar/1.1-2/XADMaster/XADStuffItHuffmanHandle.m/);
hand-built vectors have not yet been checked against archives made by the original StuffIt application.

Method 5 is LZSS with a 4 KiB pre-seeded history window and one adaptive sibling-property Huffman tree for literals and
match lengths. Symbols 0–255 are literals; symbols 256–313 represent lengths 3–60. A match then carries a prefix code
for the upper six offset bits and six raw bits for the lower offset bits, most-significant-bit first. The window seed
and output length are independent of the fork bitstream. Tests exercise literals, the seeded space run, a maximum-
distance reference and truncated input. The offset-prefix lengths are **[Fitted]** against
[macutils' method-5 decoder](https://sources.debian.org/src/macutils/2.0b3-17/macunpack/de_lzah.c/) and hand-built
fixtures; no original-application archive has yet been verified.

Method 8 is the StuffIt MW (Miller–Wegman) dictionary method. Codes are read least-significant-bit first, begin at
nine bits, and grow as the dictionary reaches powers of two. Literal codes emit one byte; later codes refer to
dictionary phrases assembled from earlier phrases. The next-free code ends a group, after which decoding restarts
with a fresh nine-bit dictionary **[Fitted]** against
[XADMaster's MW decoder](https://sources.debian.org/src/unar/1.10.8%2Bds1-9/XADStuffItOldHandles.m/) and hand-built
vectors. Tests cover phrase reconstruction, group reset, width growth and invalid/truncated input. These vectors do
not establish compatibility with files produced by the original StuffIt application.

The v1–4 record layout, methods 13, 14 and 15, archive-level comments, complete folder metadata and
verification against original-application archives remain unimplemented. See Phase 10 in [the project plan](../PLAN.md).
